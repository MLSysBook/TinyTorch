Fix Module 2 Tensor: Add sum/transpose operations and fix test standards

- Add sum() method for tensor element summation (needed by later modules)
- Add transpose property (T) for tensor transposition (required for matrix ops)
- Fix testing standards: Wrap all tests in test_ functions
- Maintain educational testing pattern with immediate test execution
- Follow TESTING_STANDARDS.md requirements for function wrapping
