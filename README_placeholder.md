# ðŸ”¥ TinyTorch: Build ML Systems from Scratch

## ðŸš§ Coming Soon from Harvard University

**TinyTorch** is an educational deep learning framework currently under development at Harvard University. This package will teach students to build complete ML systems from first principles.

### ðŸŽ¯ What's Coming

- **Complete Tensor Operations** - N-dimensional arrays with automatic differentiation
- **Neural Network Layers** - Linear, CNN, attention, and transformer blocks  
- **Training Infrastructure** - Optimizers, loss functions, and training loops
- **Educational Modules** - 14+ progressive learning modules
- **Production Tools** - CLI, testing, and deployment utilities

### ðŸ“š Educational Philosophy

Most courses teach you to USE frameworks. TinyTorch teaches you to UNDERSTAND them by building every component from scratch using only NumPy.

### ðŸš€ Stay Updated

- **Repository**: [github.com/VJ/TinyTorch](https://github.com/VJ/TinyTorch)
- **Course**: Harvard CS 287r - Machine Learning Systems
- **Instructor**: [Prof. Vijay Janapa Reddi](https://vijay.seas.harvard.edu)

### ðŸ“¦ Installation (Placeholder)

```bash
pip install tinytorch
```

Currently installs a placeholder. Full framework coming soon!
