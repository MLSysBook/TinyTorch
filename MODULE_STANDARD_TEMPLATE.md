## CRITICAL RULES FOR AGENTS

### 1. ALWAYS Include These Sections
- Module header with Learning Goals and Buildâ†’Useâ†’Understand
- ðŸ“¦ Where This Code Lives 
- All 10 Parts in order
- Immediate tests after EACH implementation
- Comprehensive tests at the end
- Module summary

### 2. Maintain 1:1 Markdown to Code Ratio
- EVERY code cell must have a preceding markdown cell
- Markdown explains what's about to happen
- Code implements it
- Test validates it

### 3. Use Exact Part Numbers and Names
```
Part 1: Concept
Part 2: Foundations  
Part 3: Context
Part 4: Connections
Part 5: Design
Part 6: Architecture
Part 7: Implementation
Part 8: Integration
Part 9: Testing
Part 10: Module Summary
```

### 4. NBGrader Metadata Pattern
- Implementation cells: `{"grade": false, "solution": true, "locked": false}`
- Test cells: `{"grade": true, "locked": true, "points": N, "solution": false}`
- grade_id format: `"[module]-[component]-[type]"`

### 5. Educational Patterns
- Build from simple to complex
- Test immediately for feedback
- Use emojis for success (âœ…, ðŸ”¥, ðŸŽ¯, ðŸš€)
- Connect to real frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- Explain WHY, not just HOW

### 6. Flexibility Within Structure
- Parts can be expanded for complex topics
- Parts can be brief for simple topics
- But ALL parts must be present
- Add subsections as needed within parts
