## üéì Educational Compression Techniques (Ranked by Learning Value)

### **Priority 1: Magnitude-Based Pruning** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why this first:** Builds directly on weight matrices students understand

#### **Learning Objectives:**
- Understand that not all parameters contribute equally to model performance
- Learn to identify and remove less important weights
- See the trade-off between model size and accuracy
- Experience sparsity in neural networks

#### **Technical Implementation:**
```python
# Students will implement:
def prune_weights_by_magnitude(layer, pruning_ratio=0.5):
    """Remove smallest weights from Dense layer."""
    weights = layer.weights.data
    threshold = np.percentile(np.abs(weights), pruning_ratio * 100)
    mask = np.abs(weights) > threshold
    layer.weights.data = weights * mask
    return layer

# Usage example:
dense_layer = Dense(784, 128)
compressed_layer = prune_weights_by_magnitude(dense_layer, pruning_ratio=0.3)
```

    # Find min/max for quantization range
    w_min, w_max = weights.min(), weights.max()
    
    # Quantize to bits precision
    scale = (w_max - w_min) / (2**bits - 1)
    quantized = np.round((weights - w_min) / scale)
    
    # Convert back to float (simulation of quantized weights)
    dequantized = quantized * scale + w_min
    
    layer.weights.data = dequantized.astype(np.float32)
    return layer, scale, w_min

#### **Technical Implementation:**
```python
# Students will implement:

    """Combined loss for knowledge distillation."""
    def __init__(self, temperature=3.0, alpha=0.5):
        self.temperature = temperature
        self.alpha = alpha
        self.ce_loss = CrossEntropyLoss()
        
    def __call__(self, student_logits, teacher_logits, true_labels):
        # Hard loss (standard classification)
        hard_loss = self.ce_loss(student_logits, true_labels)
        
        # Soft loss (distillation from teacher)
        soft_targets = softmax(teacher_logits / self.temperature)
        soft_student = softmax(student_logits / self.temperature)
        soft_loss = -np.sum(soft_targets * np.log(soft_student + 1e-10))
        
        # Combined loss
        return self.alpha * hard_loss + (1 - self.alpha) * soft_loss

# Usage example:
teacher = create_mlp(784, [512, 256, 128], 10)  # Large model
student = create_mlp(784, [64, 32], 10)         # Small model

    keep_count = int(output_size * keep_ratio)
    
    # Select most important neurons
    top_indices = np.argsort(importance_scores)[-keep_count:]
    
    # Prune weights and bias
    layer.weights.data = layer.weights.data[:, top_indices]
    if layer.bias is not None:
        layer.bias.data = layer.bias.data[top_indices]
        
    layer.output_size = keep_count
