### Command Pattern
All commands inherit from `BaseCommand` and implement:
- `name`: Command name
- `description`: Command description  
- `add_arguments()`: Argument parser setup
- `run()`: Command execution logic

### Rich Console Integration
- Use `self.console` for output
- Panel, Table, Progress for formatted output
- Color coding: green (success), red (error), yellow (warning), cyan (info)
- Consistent styling across all commands

### Configuration Management
- Access via `self.config` 
- Project paths, module directories, build settings
- Environment-specific configurations

## Implementation Standards

### 1. Argument Patterns
```python
# Standard patterns across commands
--module MODULE     # Specific module targeting
--all              # Apply to all modules  
--force            # Force operation
--dry-run          # Preview without execution
--verbose/-v       # Detailed output
--quiet/-q         # Minimal output
```

### 2. Error Handling
```python
try:
    # Command logic
    return 0  # Success
except SpecificError as e:
    console.print(f"[red]Error: {e}[/red]")
    console.print(f"[dim]Hint: {helpful_suggestion}[/dim]")
    return 1  # Failure
```

### 3. Output Consistency
```python
# Success messages
console.print(Panel("✅ Operation completed successfully", border_style="green"))

# Progress indicators  
with console.status("Processing..."):
    # Long operation

# Structured data
table = Table()
table.add_column("Module")
table.add_column("Status")
console.print(table)
```

### 4. Help Documentation
```python
def add_arguments(self, parser: ArgumentParser) -> None:
    parser.add_argument(
        '--module',
        help='Target specific module (e.g., 02_tensor, 04_layers)',
        metavar='MODULE'
    )
    # Include examples in help text
```

## Maintenance Protocol
