# TinyTorch üî•

Learn ML systems engineering by building your own PyTorch from scratch!

## What is TinyTorch?

TinyTorch transforms how you learn deep learning by focusing on **systems engineering**. Instead of just using ML libraries, you'll build one yourself, understanding every component from memory management to optimization algorithms. This hands-on approach teaches you how real ML systems work under the hood.

## Why Systems Matter

Modern ML is all about systems:
- **Memory efficiency**: How do you train models larger than GPU memory?
- **Performance optimization**: Why does your training take forever?
- **Scaling**: How do you distribute training across multiple GPUs?
- **Production deployment**: How do real companies serve billions of predictions?

## Features

- üèóÔ∏è **Systems-First Learning**: Build from tensors to transformers
- üìä **Performance Analysis**: Profile memory usage and computational complexity
- üîß **Industry Practices**: Learn how PyTorch and TensorFlow actually work
- üéØ **Real Applications**: Train CNNs on CIFAR-10, not toy datasets
- üéì **Course Ready**: NBGrader integration for educators

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/tinytorch/tinytorch
cd tinytorch && ./setup-dev.sh

# Start your ML systems journey

```

## Learning Path

**üèóÔ∏è Foundation** (Modules 1-5): Build the core infrastructure
**üß† Intelligence** (Modules 6-10): Add learning and optimization
**‚ö° Performance** (Modules 11-15): Scale to production systems
**üöÄ Capstone** (Module 16): Build TinyGPT end-to-end

## For Students
