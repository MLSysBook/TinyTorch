## Workflow Coordination

### Standard Development Flow
```
User Request ‚Üí TPM ‚Üí Specialized Agents ‚Üí Quality Gates ‚Üí Delivery
```

### Agent Handoff Criteria
- Module Developer ‚Üí QA Agent (after implementation complete)
- QA Agent ‚Üí Package Manager (after tests pass)
- Package Manager ‚Üí TPM (after integration verified)
- Education Reviewer ‚Üí Module Developer (after educational specs complete)
- Website Manager ‚Üí Implementation teams (after content strategy complete)

### Quality Gates
- **QA Agent can block**: No commits without test approval
- **Package Manager can block**: No releases without integration verification
- **TPM coordinates**: Final approval and user communication

## REMOVED AGENTS (Historical Reference)
These agents were consolidated into the current 7-agent structure:
- Education Architect ‚Üí merged into Education Reviewer
- Website Content Strategist ‚Üí merged into Website Manager
- Website Designer ‚Üí merged into Website Manager
- Assessment Designer ‚Üí merged into Education Reviewer
- TITO CLI Developer ‚Üí became DevOps TITO
- ML Framework Advisor ‚Üí capabilities distributed among agents
- Educational Review Expert ‚Üí merged into Education Reviewer

## Agent Communication Protocol
All agents follow structured handoffs with:
1. What was completed
2. What needs to be done next
3. Any issues found
4. Test results (if applicable)
5. Recommendations for next agent
