# Unified Module Template for TinyTorch

## Philosophy
We combine deep educational content with consistent structure. The 5 C's framework is used as an optional quick reference, not as a replacement for comprehensive explanations.

## The Module Stencil

## ðŸ“¦ Where This Code Lives in the Final Package

**Learning Side:** You work in `modules/source/XX_name/name_dev.py`  
**Building Side:** Code exports to `tinytorch.core.name`

```python
# Final package structure example
from tinytorch.core.name import MainClass
```

**Why this matters:**
- **Learning:** [Educational benefit]
- **Production:** [How it relates to real systems]
- **Consistency:** [Package organization]
- **Foundation:** [How other modules depend on this]

## Key Principles

### 1. Educational Depth First
- Don't sacrifice explanation for structure
- It's okay to be verbose if it aids understanding
- Real-world examples are crucial

### 2. Avoid Duplication
- If content fits naturally in existing sections, don't repeat it
- The 5 C's is optional - use only if it adds value as a checkpoint
- Map concepts to where they naturally belong

### 3. Consistent Flow
```
Theory/Understanding â†’ Design/Architecture â†’ Implementation â†’ Testing â†’ Summary
```

### 4. Unique TinyTorch Elements to Preserve
- **"Where This Code Lives"**: Shows the learning-to-production path
- **Build â†’ Use â†’ Understand**: Our pedagogical framework
- **Real-world connections**: Links to PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.
- **Performance considerations**: Systems thinking

### 5. When to Use the 5 C's
Use the condensed 5 C's checkpoint when:
- Starting a complex implementation
- Students need a quick reference
- It provides a helpful summary without duplication

Skip it when:
- The content is already covered in detail above
- It would be redundant
- The implementation is straightforward

## Module Categories

### Foundation Modules (01-05)
- More mathematical foundation
- Detailed explanations of core concepts
- Extensive "Why not just use X?" sections

### System Modules (06-10)
- Focus on architecture and design patterns
- Performance becomes more critical
- Integration between components

### Advanced Modules (11-14)
- Real-world optimizations
- Production considerations
- Industry best practices

## Flexibility Within Consistency

While maintaining this structure, each module can:
- Expand sections that are most relevant
- Add module-specific sections as needed
- Adjust depth based on complexity
- Include additional examples for difficult concepts

## The Goal

Create modules that:
1. Teach deeply, not just functionally
2. Connect theory to practice
3. Build systematic understanding
4. Prepare students for real ML engineering
5. Maintain consistent structure without sacrificing content

## Remember

**We're not trying to make modules shorter or more streamlined at the cost of education.**

We're organizing rich educational content in a consistent, learnable structure. If a module needs 1000 lines to properly teach a concept, that's perfectly fine. The structure helps students navigate, not limit content.
