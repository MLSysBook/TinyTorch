## üöÄ Demo Progression

The demos unlock progressively as you export modules:

### Foundation (Modules 2-5)
- **Tensor Math**: Matrix operations, linear systems
- **Activations**: Nonlinear functions, sigmoid/ReLU
- **Single Neuron**: Gradient descent learning
- **XOR Network**: Multi-layer breakthrough

### Intelligence (Modules 6-7)
- **Computer Vision**: CNNs, edge detection, pattern recognition
- **Attention**: Sequence understanding, transformer mechanisms

### Complete Systems (Modules 11-16)
- **Training**: End-to-end ML pipelines
- **Language**: Text generation, TinyGPT

## üéì Educational Value

Each demo is designed to:

1. **Show Real AI Capabilities**: Not just code, but actual intelligence in action
2. **Explain the "Why"**: Understanding principles behind the implementations
3. **Connect to Production**: How these concepts scale to real ML systems
4. **Build Excitement**: See your framework grow more capable with each module

## üîß Technical Details

- **Import Safety**: Each demo gracefully handles missing modules
- **Error Recovery**: Clear messages about which modules need to be exported
- **Rich Output**: Color-coded, formatted demonstrations with explanations
- **Self-Contained**: Each demo can run independently for testing
