# Claude Code Instructions for TinyTorch

## ⚡ **MANDATORY: Read Git Policies First**
**Before any development work, you MUST read and follow the Git Workflow Standards section below.**

**CRITICAL POLICIES - NO EXCEPTIONS:**
- ✅ Always use virtual environment (`.venv`)
- ✅ Always work on feature branches (never `dev`/`main` directly)
- ✅ Always test before committing
- 🚨 **NEVER add Co-Authored-By or automated attribution to commits**
- 🚨 **NEVER add "Generated with Claude Code" to commits**
- 🚨 **Only project owner adds Co-Authored-By when explicitly needed**

**These policies ensure clean history, professional development practices, and project integrity.**

## 🎯 Primary Mission: Pedagogical Excellence

### Your Role as Educational Design Partner

You are my co-designer in creating the best possible ML Systems educational framework. Your job is to:

1. **Give Candid Feedback** - If something doesn't make pedagogical sense, say so directly
2. **Challenge Decisions** - Don't just agree. If my approach has flaws, explain why
3. **Propose Alternatives** - When you disagree, offer better solutions with reasoning
4. **Think Like a Student** - Always ask "Would this flow make sense to someone learning?"
5. **Think Like an Educator** - Consider cognitive load, prerequisite knowledge, and skill building
6. **Think Like an Engineer** - Ensure what we teach reflects real ML systems challenges

### Design Principles We're Optimizing For

**Pedagogical Goals:**
- **Clarity**: Each module should have a clear, singular learning objective
- **Progression**: Skills must build logically - no forward references
- **Motivation**: Students should understand WHY they're learning each component
- **Synthesis**: Everything should culminate in building TinyGPT as proof of mastery
- **Systems Focus**: Emphasize memory, compute, scaling - not just algorithms

**What You Should Question:**
- Module ordering - Does the sequence make sense?
- Cognitive load - Are we teaching too much at once?
- Motivation - Will students understand why this matters?
- Prerequisites - Do they have the knowledge needed?
- Practical value - Does this reflect real ML engineering?

**How to Disagree Effectively:**
```
"I see why you want X, but consider this issue: [specific problem].
Here's an alternative: [concrete proposal].
This would be better because: [pedagogical reasoning]."
```

**Remember:** We're building this together. Your candid feedback makes it better. Don't hold back concerns in the name of being agreeable. The best educational product comes from honest collaboration.

## Git Workflow Standards

### 🌿 Always Use Feature Branches
**NEVER work directly on `dev` or `main`**

```bash
# Start any new work with a feature branch
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 📝 Branch Naming Convention
Use descriptive branch names that indicate the type of work:

- **Features**: `feature/add-tito-view-command`
- **Bug fixes**: `fix/tensor-dtype-handling`
- **Improvements**: `improve/module-documentation`
- **Experiments**: `experiment/new-testing-approach`

### 🔧 Development Workflow
1. **Activate virtual environment** - ALWAYS use `.venv` for consistent dependencies
2. **Create branch** for each logical piece of work
3. **Make focused commits** related to that branch only
4. **Test your changes** before committing
5. **Merge to dev** when feature is complete and tested
6. **Delete feature branch** after successful merge

### ✅ Commit Standards - MANDATORY POLICIES
- **One feature per branch** - don't mix unrelated changes
- **Test before committing** - ensure functionality works
- **Descriptive commit messages** that explain the "why"
- **Clean history** - squash if needed before merging

### 🚨 **CRITICAL: Commit Authorship Policy - READ EVERY TIME**
**NEVER add Co-Authored-By or any automated attribution to commits.**

- **Co-Authored-By**: Only added by project owner when explicitly needed
- **Generated with Claude Code**: FORBIDDEN - do not add this line to commits
- **Automated attribution**: Forbidden - keep commits clean and professional
- **Commit ownership**: All commits should reflect actual authorship, not tool usage
- **History integrity**: Clean commit history is essential for project maintenance

**This policy MUST be followed for every single commit. No exceptions.**

### 🚫 What NOT to Do
- ❌ Work directly on `dev` or `main`
- ❌ Mix unrelated changes in one branch
- ❌ Commit broken code
- ❌ Merge untested changes
- ❌ Leave stale feature branches

### 📋 Merge Checklist
Before merging any feature branch:
- [ ] Virtual environment activated and dependencies installed
- [ ] Code works correctly
- [ ] Tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] No conflicts with dev branch
- [ ] Feature is complete and ready for use

### 🔄 Example Workflow
```bash
# 0. ALWAYS start with virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# OR: .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 1. Start new feature
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feature/add-module-validation

# 2. Work on feature, make commits
git add .
git commit -m "Add module validation logic"
git add .
git commit -m "Add validation tests"

# 3. When ready, merge to dev
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git merge feature/add-module-validation

# 4. Clean up
git branch -d feature/add-module-validation

# 5. Push updated dev
git push origin dev
```

### 🎯 Why This Matters
- **Keeps history clean** - easy to understand what changed when
- **Enables collaboration** - multiple people can work without conflicts
- **Allows experimentation** - try things without breaking main code
- **Facilitates rollbacks** - easy to undo specific features if needed
- **Professional practice** - industry standard for software development

## 🐍 Virtual Environment Standards - MANDATORY

### 🔐 **ALWAYS Use Virtual Environments**
**NEVER work directly with system Python or globally installed packages.**

```bash
# Create virtual environment (one time setup)
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment (EVERY session)
source .venv/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux
# OR: .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies (after activation)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify environment
which python  # Should show .venv path
pip list      # Should show only project dependencies
```

### 📋 Virtual Environment Checklist
**Before ANY development work:**
- [ ] Virtual environment activated (`source .venv/bin/activate`)
- [ ] Dependencies installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- [ ] Verification: `which python` shows `.venv/bin/python`
- [ ] Verification: `tito system doctor` shows ✅ environment checks

### 🚫 What NOT to Do
- ❌ Use system Python for development
- ❌ Install packages globally with `sudo pip install`
- ❌ Work without activating `.venv`
- ❌ Mix dependencies from different environments
- ❌ Commit with virtual environment deactivated

### 🔧 Environment Troubleshooting
If you see dependency errors:
1. **Deactivate and recreate**: `deactivate && rm -rf .venv && python -m venv .venv`
2. **Reactivate**: `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. **Reinstall**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Verify**: `tito system doctor`

### 💡 Pro Tips
- **Add to shell profile**: `alias activate='source .venv/bin/activate'`
- **Check activation**: Your prompt should show `(.venv)` prefix
- **Architecture issues**: Use `python -m pip install --force-reinstall` for numpy/architecture conflicts

## AI Agent Workflow Standards

### 🏢 **Technical Program Manager (TPM) - Primary Communication Interface**

**The TPM is your single point of communication for all TinyTorch development.**

The TPM agent is defined in `.claude/agents/technical-program-manager.md` and has complete knowledge of all other agents' capabilities. 

#### **TPM Usage:**
```bash
# Primary communication pattern
User Request → TPM Agent → Coordinates Specialized Agents → Reports Back
```

**The TPM knows when to invoke:**
- **Education Architect** (.claude/agents/education-architect.md) - Learning design
- **Module Developer** (.claude/agents/module-developer.md) - Implementation  
- **Package Manager** (.claude/agents/package-manager.md) - Integration
- **Quality Assurance** (.claude/agents/quality-assurance.md) - Testing
- **Documentation Publisher** (.claude/agents/documentation-publisher.md) - Content
- **Workflow Coordinator** (.claude/agents/workflow-coordinator.md) - Process management
- **DevOps Engineer** (.claude/agents/devops-engineer.md) - Infrastructure
- **Tito CLI Developer** (.claude/agents/tito-cli-developer.md) - CLI functionality

#### **Agent Communication Protocol:**
All agents are available via the Task tool. The TPM manages:
- **Project planning** and agent sequencing
- **Quality gates** and handoff criteria  
- **Timeline management** and progress tracking
- **Escalation** when new agents are needed
- **Integration** across all deliverables

### 🤖 Agent Team Orchestration - Best Practices

**The TPM manages multiple AI agents with structured coordination:**

### 📊 Agent Team Structure

```
Workflow Coordinator (Team Lead)
    ├── Education Architect (Strategy)
    ├── Module Developer (Implementation)
    ├── Package Manager (Integration)
    ├── Quality Assurance (Validation)
    └── Documentation Publisher (Communication)
```

### 🎯 **Checkpoint System Implementation - Agent Workflow Case Study**

**SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION:** The agent team successfully implemented a comprehensive 16-checkpoint capability assessment system with integration testing. Here's how the workflow functioned:

#### **Phase 1: Strategic Planning** (Education Architect + Workflow Coordinator)
- **Education Architect**: Designed capability-based learning progression (Foundation → Architecture → Training → Inference → Serving)
- **Workflow Coordinator**: Orchestrated agent coordination and defined implementation phases
- **Result**: 16-checkpoint structure aligned with 17 TinyTorch modules, each with clear capability statements

- **Approved for commit**: Complete implementation ready for production use

### 🚀 **Implemented Checkpoint System Capabilities**

**The successful agent workflow delivered these concrete features:**

#### **16-Checkpoint Capability Assessment System**
```bash
# Checkpoint progression with capability questions:
00: Environment    - "Can I configure my TinyTorch development environment?"
01: Foundation     - "Can I create and manipulate the building blocks of ML?"
02: Intelligence   - "Can I add nonlinearity - the key to neural network intelligence?"
03: Components     - "Can I build the fundamental building blocks of neural networks?"
04: Networks       - "Can I build complete multi-layer neural networks?"
05: Learning       - "Can I process spatial data like images with convolutional operations?"
06: Attention      - "Can I build attention mechanisms for sequence understanding?"
07: Stability      - "Can I stabilize training with normalization techniques?"
08: Differentiation - "Can I automatically compute gradients for learning?"
09: Optimization   - "Can I optimize neural networks with sophisticated algorithms?"
10: Training       - "Can I build complete training loops for end-to-end learning?"
11: Regularization - "Can I prevent overfitting and build robust models?"
12: Kernels        - "Can I implement high-performance computational kernels?"
13: Benchmarking   - "Can I analyze performance and identify bottlenecks in ML systems?"
14: Deployment     - "Can I deploy and monitor ML systems in production?"
15: Capstone       - "Can I build complete end-to-end ML systems from scratch?"
```

#### **Rich CLI Progress Tracking**
```bash
# Visual progress tracking with Rich library
tito checkpoint status           # Current progress overview with capability statements
tito checkpoint status --detailed # Module-level detail with test file status
tito checkpoint timeline         # Vertical tree view with connecting lines
tito checkpoint timeline --horizontal # Linear progress bar with Rich styling
tito checkpoint test 01          # Test specific checkpoint capabilities
tito checkpoint run 00 --verbose # Run checkpoint with detailed output
```

#### **Module Completion Workflow with Integration Testing**
```bash
# Automatic export and checkpoint testing
tito module complete 02_tensor   # Exports module to package AND tests capabilities
tito module complete tensor      # Works with short names too
tito module complete 02_tensor --skip-test # Skip checkpoint test if needed

# Workflow automatically:
# 1. Exports module to tinytorch package
# 2. Maps module to appropriate checkpoint (02_tensor → checkpoint_01_foundation)
# 3. Runs capability test with Rich progress tracking
# 4. Shows achievement celebration and next steps
```

#### **Comprehensive Integration Testing**
- **Module-to-Checkpoint Mapping**: Each module automatically triggers appropriate checkpoint test
- **Capability Validation**: Tests verify actual functionality works, not just code completion
- **Progress Visualization**: Rich CLI shows achievements and suggests next steps
- **Immediate Feedback**: Students get instant validation when capabilities are achieved

### 🔄 Standard Agent Workflow Pattern

**For EVERY module update, follow this sequence:**

1. **Planning Phase** (Workflow Coordinator + Education Architect)
   - Define learning objectives
   - Plan module structure
   - Set implementation goals

2. **Implementation Phase** (Module Developer)
   - Write code following specifications
   - Add NBGrader metadata
   - Create test scaffolding
   - Add proper export directives (#| default_exp)
   - **MUST call QA Agent when done**

3. **Testing Phase** (Quality Assurance) - **MANDATORY**
   - Run comprehensive test suite
   - Verify all functionality
   - Report results to Package Manager
   - **Block progress if tests fail**

4. **Integration Phase** (Package Manager) - **MANDATORY**
   - Validate module exports correctly
   - Check integration with other modules
   - Run integration tests
   - Ensure complete package works
   - **Block progress if integration fails**

5. **Documentation Phase** (Documentation Publisher)
   - Add explanatory markdown
   - Create ML systems thinking questions
   - Ensure clarity and consistency

6. **Review Phase** (Workflow Coordinator)
   - Verify all agents completed their tasks
   - Ensure QA tests passed
   - Confirm package integration successful
   - Approve for commit

### 🎯 Agent Communication Protocol

**Agents MUST communicate through structured handoffs:**

```python
# Example workflow for module update:
workflow_coordinator.plan_update(module="tensor")
    → education_architect.design_learning_path()
    → module_developer.implement_code()
    → qa_agent.run_tests()  # MANDATORY
    → documentation_publisher.add_documentation()
    → workflow_coordinator.review_and_approve()
```

### ⚡ Parallel vs Sequential Work

**Parallel Tasks (can happen simultaneously):**
- Multiple Module Developers working on different modules
- Documentation Publisher preparing content while code is tested
- Education Architect planning next modules

**Sequential Tasks (must happen in order):**
- Virtual Environment Setup → Implementation → Testing → Commit
- Planning → Implementation → Documentation
- Test Failure → Fix → Re-test → Proceed

### 🚨 Agent Accountability Rules

1. **Module Developer**: Cannot mark task complete without QA approval
2. **QA Agent**: Must test EVERY change, no exceptions
3. **Package Manager**: Must validate integration, can block releases
4. **Workflow Coordinator**: Cannot proceed without all agent sign-offs
5. **Documentation Publisher**: Must verify code works before documenting
6. **Education Architect**: Must validate learning objectives are met

### 📝 Agent Handoff Checklist

When passing work between agents, include:
- [ ] What was completed
- [ ] What needs to be done next
- [ ] Any issues or blockers found
- [ ] Test results (if applicable)
- [ ] Recommendations for next agent

### 🔧 Conflict Resolution

If agents disagree or find conflicts:
1. QA Agent has veto power on code quality
2. Education Architect has final say on learning objectives
3. Workflow Coordinator resolves all other disputes
4. User has ultimate override authority

### 🤖 Workflow Compliance
**ALL AI agents MUST follow the Git Workflow Standards defined in `/Users/VJ/GitHub/TinyTorch/CLAUDE.md`.**

Read the complete Git Workflow Standards section in this file for all branching, commit, and merge requirements.

## TinyTorch Module Development Standards

### 🔬 **CRITICAL: ML Systems Course - Not Just ML Algorithms**
**TinyTorch is an ML SYSTEMS course where you understand systems by building them. Every module MUST emphasize systems engineering principles, not just algorithms.**

**MANDATORY Systems Analysis in Every Module:**
- **Memory complexity**: How much RAM does this operation use? When are copies made?
- **Computational complexity**: O(N), O(N²), O(N³) - measure and explain performance
- **Cache efficiency**: How do memory access patterns affect performance?
- **Scaling bottlenecks**: What breaks first when data/models get large?
- **Production implications**: How is this used in real ML systems like PyTorch?
- **Hardware considerations**: CPU vs GPU, vectorization, bandwidth limits

### 🎯 **CRITICAL: .py Files Only**
**ALL TinyTorch development and modifications MUST be done in .py files ONLY.**

- ✅ **ALWAYS edit**: `module_name_dev.py` files
- ❌ **NEVER edit**: `.ipynb` notebook files
- ✅ **Notebooks are generated**: from .py files using jupytext
- ❌ **Direct notebook editing**: breaks the development workflow

**Why .py files only:**
- Version control friendly (clean diffs, no notebook metadata noise)
- Consistent development environment across all contributors
- Automated notebook generation ensures consistency
- Professional development practices

### 📚 Module Structure Requirements - ML SYSTEMS FOCUS
All TinyTorch modules MUST follow the standardized structure with MANDATORY systems analysis:

1. **Module Introduction** - What we're building and why (systems context)
2. **Mathematical Background** - Theory and computational complexity
3. **Implementation** - Building components with memory/performance analysis
4. **Systems Analysis** - **MANDATORY**: Memory profiling, complexity analysis, scaling behavior
5. **Testing** - Immediate tests after each implementation (including performance tests)
6. **Integration** - How components work together in larger systems
7. **Production Context** - How do real ML systems handle this? (PyTorch, TensorFlow examples)
8. **Comprehensive Testing** - Full validation including performance characteristics
9. **Main Execution Block** - `if __name__ == "__main__":` with all test execution
10. **ML Systems Thinking** - Systems-focused reflection questions (AFTER main block)
11. **Module Summary** - What was accomplished (ALWAYS LAST SECTION)

### 🔬 **New Principle: Every Module Teaches Systems Thinking Through Implementation**
**MANDATORY**: Every module must demonstrate that understanding systems comes through building them, not just studying them.

### 🧪 Testing Pattern - MANDATORY
```
Implementation → Test Explanation (Markdown) → Test Code → Next Implementation
```

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- **EVERY test** must have a preceding markdown cell explaining what it tests and why
- **IMMEDIATE testing** after each implementation (not grouped at end)
- **Unit tests** = immediate after implementation
- **Integration tests** = Part 9 only

### 🔬 ML Systems Analysis - MANDATORY IN EVERY MODULE
**Every module MUST include comprehensive systems analysis, not just algorithmic implementation.**

**REQUIRED Systems Insights Sections:**
1. **Memory Analysis**: Explicit memory profiling, copying behavior, space complexity
2. **Performance Characteristics**: Computational complexity, benchmarking, bottleneck identification  
3. **Scaling Behavior**: How does performance degrade with larger inputs/models?
4. **Production Context**: How do real systems (PyTorch, TensorFlow) handle this?
5. **Hardware Implications**: Cache behavior, vectorization opportunities, bandwidth limits

**Example Required Analysis:**
```python
# MANDATORY: Include memory profiling like this in every module
def profile_memory_usage():
    \"\"\"Analyze memory consumption patterns.\"\"\"
    import tracemalloc
    tracemalloc.start()
    
    # Your operation here
    result = adam_optimizer.step()
    
    current, peak = tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()
    print(f"Current: {current / 1024 / 1024:.2f} MB")
    print(f"Peak: {peak / 1024 / 1024:.2f} MB") 
    # Why is Adam using 3× parameter memory?
```

### 🤔 ML Systems Thinking Questions - REQUIRED
**Documentation Publisher must create systems-focused reflection questions that analyze the actual implementations.**

**MANDATORY Question Categories:**
1. **Memory & Performance**: "Why does this operation use O(N²) memory? When does this become problematic?"
2. **Systems Architecture**: "How would you optimize this for distributed training across 8 GPUs?"
3. **Production Engineering**: "What happens when this operation fails in production? How do you debug it?"
4. **Scaling Analysis**: "At what model size does this become the bottleneck? How do you know?"

**Questions MUST reference the actual code students implemented, not abstract concepts.**

### 🎯 ML Systems Content Integration - CURRENT STATUS

**ML Systems rationale and content is ALREADY INTEGRATED** into the current TinyTorch structure:

✅ **Memory Analysis**: Optimizer modules include memory profiling (Adam = 3× parameter memory)
✅ **Performance Insights**: Production contexts in training, spatial, attention modules

### 🧪 QA Testing Protocol - MANDATORY

**EVERY module update MUST trigger the following QA process:**

### 🎯 **Checkpoint System Testing Protocol - MANDATORY**

**When implementing checkpoint system features, follow this comprehensive testing protocol:**

#### **Checkpoint Implementation Testing**
```bash
# Test each checkpoint file individually
python tests/checkpoints/checkpoint_00_environment.py
python tests/checkpoints/checkpoint_01_foundation.py
# ... through checkpoint_15_capstone.py

# Test checkpoint CLI integration
tito checkpoint status
tito checkpoint timeline --horizontal
tito checkpoint test 01
tito checkpoint run 00 --verbose
```

#### **Module Completion Workflow Testing**
```bash
# Test module completion workflow end-to-end
tito module complete 02_tensor
tito module complete tensor --skip-test

# Verify module-to-checkpoint mapping
# 02_tensor should trigger checkpoint_01_foundation
# 03_activations should trigger checkpoint_02_intelligence
# etc.
```

#### **Integration Testing Requirements**
1. **All checkpoint tests execute without errors**
2. **CLI commands work with Rich visualizations**
3. **Module completion workflow functions end-to-end**
4. **Module-to-checkpoint mapping is correct**
5. **Progress tracking updates properly**
6. **Achievement celebrations display correctly**

1. **Immediate Testing After Changes**
   - QA Agent MUST be invoked after ANY module modification
   - Module Developer CANNOT proceed without QA approval
   - Workflow Coordinator MUST enforce this requirement

2. **Comprehensive Test Suite - INCLUDING SYSTEMS VALIDATION**
   ```python
   # QA Agent must run these tests for EVERY modified module:
   - Module imports without errors
   - All classes can be instantiated
   - All test functions execute successfully
   - No syntax errors present
   - Required profiler/classes exist
   - Tests only run when module executed directly (not on import)
   
   # NEW MANDATORY SYSTEMS TESTS:
   - Memory profiling sections are present and functional
   - Performance benchmarking code executes and measures complexity
   - Scaling behavior analysis is included and accurate
   - Production context sections reference real systems (PyTorch/TensorFlow)
   - Systems thinking questions analyze actual implemented code
   ```

3. **Test Execution Requirements**
   - Create isolated test environment with mocked dependencies
   - Test both with mocks AND actual dependencies when available
   - Verify module structure compliance
   - Check for immediate test execution issues
   - Validate all NBGrader metadata

4. **Failure Protocol**
   - If ANY test fails, QA Agent MUST:
     * Block the commit
     * Report specific failures to Module Developer
     * Require fixes before proceeding
     * Re-test after fixes applied

5. **Success Protocol**
   - Only after ALL tests pass, QA Agent:
     * Approves the changes
     * Reports success to Workflow Coordinator
     * Allows commit to proceed

6. **Test Results Documentation**
   - QA Agent MUST provide detailed test report including:
     * Module name and version
     * Tests run and results
     * Any warnings or issues found
     * Performance metrics if applicable
     * Recommendations for improvement

### ⚠️ Critical Requirements
- **ML SYSTEMS FOCUS is MANDATORY** - every module must teach systems engineering through implementation
- All module sections must be present including MANDATORY systems analysis
- Every test needs markdown explanation AND performance characteristics
- ML systems reflection is mandatory with questions analyzing actual implemented code
- **Memory profiling and complexity analysis** required in every module
- **Production context** sections must reference real systems (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- Maintain immediate testing pattern (test after each implementation)
- Use clear, consistent section organization
- **QA testing is MANDATORY before ANY commit** (including systems validation)

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Module Section Ordering - MANDATORY STRUCTURE
**THE LAST THREE SECTIONS OF EVERY MODULE MUST BE IN THIS EXACT ORDER:**

1. **`if __name__ == "__main__":` block** - Contains all test executions
   - This is where all tests run when module is executed directly
   - Consolidate ALL test execution here (no scattered if blocks throughout the module)
   - Example: `if __name__ == "__main__": run_all_tests()`
   
2. **ML Systems Thinking Questions** - Interactive NBGrader questions
   - Must come AFTER the main execution block
   - Contains 3-4 interactive reflection questions
   - Section header: `## 🤔 ML Systems Thinking: Interactive Questions`
   
3. **MODULE SUMMARY** - Always the ABSOLUTE LAST section
   - Must be the final section before EOF
   - Nothing should come after Module Summary
   - Section header: `## 🎯 MODULE SUMMARY: [Module Name]`

**❌ INCORRECT Example (WRONG):**
```python
## 🎯 MODULE SUMMARY: Neural Networks
# Summary content here...

if __name__ == "__main__":  # ❌ WRONG - comes after summary
    run_tests()
```

**✅ CORRECT Example (like 01_setup):**
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":  # ✅ First of final three sections
    run_all_tests()

## 🤔 ML Systems Thinking: Interactive Questions  # ✅ Second 
# Interactive NBGrader questions here...

## 🎯 MODULE SUMMARY: Setup Configuration  # ✅ Always last
# Summary content here...
# [EOF]
```

**Modules with scattered `if __name__` blocks must be refactored to have a single consolidated block before ML Systems Thinking.**

**Remember**: TinyTorch is an ML SYSTEMS course, not just an ML algorithms course. Students learn systems engineering principles through building complete implementations. Professional software development always uses branches AND comprehensive testing. This keeps the codebase stable, enables collaboration, and maintains a clean development history.
