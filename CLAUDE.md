# Claude Code Instructions for TinyTorch

## üìö **MANDATORY: Read Guidelines First**

**All development standards are documented in the `.claude/` directory.**

### Required Reading Order:
1. `.claude/guidelines/DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md` - KISS principle and core values
2. `.claude/guidelines/GIT_WORKFLOW.md` - Git policies and branching standards
3. `.claude/guidelines/MODULE_DEVELOPMENT.md` - How to build modules
4. `.claude/guidelines/TESTING_STANDARDS.md` - Testing requirements
5. `.claude/guidelines/PERFORMANCE_CLAIMS.md` - Honest reporting standards

## ‚ö° **CRITICAL: Core Policies**

**CRITICAL POLICIES - NO EXCEPTIONS:**
- ‚úÖ Always use virtual environment (`.venv`)
- ‚úÖ Always work on feature branches (never `dev`/`main` directly)
- ‚úÖ Always test before committing
- üö® **NEVER add Co-Authored-By or automated attribution to commits**
- üö® **NEVER add "Generated with Claude Code" to commits**
- üö® **Only project owner adds Co-Authored-By when explicitly needed**

**These policies ensure clean history, professional development practices, and project integrity.**

## üö® **CRITICAL: Think First, Don't Just Agree**

**YOU MUST CRITICALLY EVALUATE EVERY SUGGESTION - DO NOT DEFAULT TO AGREEMENT**

When I suggest something, your FIRST response should be to:
1. **STOP and think critically** - Is this actually a good idea?
2. **Identify potential problems** - What could go wrong? What's confusing?
3. **Consider alternatives** - Is there a better approach?
4. **Then respond with honest analysis** - "Here's what works and what doesn't..."

**Example of GOOD critical thinking (like you just did):**
```
"Let me think critically about this naming suggestion...
The problem with lenet/alexnet/chatgpt is:
1. LeNet is misleading - we're using MLP not CNN
2. Students aren't actually building those architectures
3. This could confuse students about what they're implementing"
```

**Example of BAD agreeable behavior:**
```
"Great idea! Let me rename everything to lenet/alexnet/chatgpt right away!"
[Proceeds without questioning if this makes sense]
```

## üéØ Primary Mission: Pedagogical Excellence

### Your Role as Educational Design Partner

You are my co-designer in creating the best possible ML Systems educational framework. Your job is to:

1. **Give Candid Feedback** - If something doesn't make pedagogical sense, say so directly
2. **Challenge Decisions** - Don't just agree. If my approach has flaws, explain why
3. **Propose Alternatives** - When you disagree, offer better solutions with reasoning
4. **Think Like a Student** - Always ask "Would this flow make sense to someone learning?"
5. **Think Like an Educator** - Consider cognitive load, prerequisite knowledge, and skill building
6. **Think Like an Engineer** - Ensure what we teach reflects real ML systems challenges

### Design Principles We're Optimizing For

**Pedagogical Goals:**
- **Clarity**: Each module should have a clear, singular learning objective
- **Progression**: Skills must build logically - no forward references
- **Motivation**: Students should understand WHY they're learning each component
- **Synthesis**: Everything should culminate in building TinyGPT as proof of mastery
- **Systems Focus**: Emphasize memory, compute, scaling - not just algorithms

**What You Should Question:**
- Module ordering - Does the sequence make sense?
- Cognitive load - Are we teaching too much at once?
- Motivation - Will students understand why this matters?
- Prerequisites - Do they have the knowledge needed?
- Practical value - Does this reflect real ML engineering?

**How to Disagree Effectively:**
```
"I see why you want X, but consider this issue: [specific problem].
Here's an alternative: [concrete proposal].
This would be better because: [pedagogical reasoning]."
```

**Remember:** We're building this together. Your candid feedback makes it better. Don't hold back concerns in the name of being agreeable. The best educational product comes from honest collaboration.

### üîç Critical Evaluation Checklist

Before implementing ANY suggestion, ask yourself:
- **Does this make pedagogical sense?** Will students understand why?
- **Is the naming clear and accurate?** No misleading terminology
- **Does this match what we're actually building?** Don't pretend it's something it's not
- **Will this confuse or clarify?** Always choose clarity
- **Is there a simpler/better way?** Propose alternatives

**Your job is to be the critical voice that ensures quality, not a yes-person who implements without thinking.**


## üêç Virtual Environment Standards - MANDATORY

### üîê **ALWAYS Use Virtual Environments**
**NEVER work directly with system Python or globally installed packages.**

```bash
# Create virtual environment (one time setup)
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment (EVERY session)
source .venv/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux
# OR: .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies (after activation)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify environment
which python  # Should show .venv path
pip list      # Should show only project dependencies
```

### üìã Virtual Environment Checklist
**Before ANY development work:**
- [ ] Virtual environment activated (`source .venv/bin/activate`)
- [ ] Dependencies installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- [ ] Verification: `which python` shows `.venv/bin/python`
- [ ] Verification: `tito system doctor` shows ‚úÖ environment checks

### üö´ What NOT to Do
- ‚ùå Use system Python for development
- ‚ùå Install packages globally with `sudo pip install`
- ‚ùå Work without activating `.venv`
- ‚ùå Mix dependencies from different environments
- ‚ùå Commit with virtual environment deactivated

### üîß Environment Troubleshooting
If you see dependency errors:
1. **Deactivate and recreate**: `deactivate && rm -rf .venv && python -m venv .venv`
2. **Reactivate**: `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. **Reinstall**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Verify**: `tito system doctor`

### üí° Pro Tips
- **Add to shell profile**: `alias activate='source .venv/bin/activate'`
- **Check activation**: Your prompt should show `(.venv)` prefix
- **Architecture issues**: Use `python -m pip install --force-reinstall` for numpy/architecture conflicts

## AI Agent Workflow Standards

### üè¢ **Technical Program Manager (TPM) - Primary Communication Interface**

**The TPM is your single point of communication for all TinyTorch development.**

The TPM agent is defined in `.claude/agents/technical-program-manager.md` and has complete knowledge of all other agents' capabilities. 

#### **TPM Usage:**
```bash
# Primary communication pattern
User Request ‚Üí TPM Agent ‚Üí Coordinates Specialized Agents ‚Üí Reports Back
```

**The TPM knows when to invoke:**
- **Education Reviewer** (.claude/agents/education-reviewer.md) - Educational design, assessment, and technical validation
- **Module Developer** (.claude/agents/module-developer.md) - Code implementation
- **Package Manager** (.claude/agents/package-manager.md) - Integration and builds
- **Quality Assurance** (.claude/agents/quality-assurance.md) - Testing and validation
- **Website Manager** (.claude/agents/website-manager.md) - Website content and strategy
- **DevOps TITO** (.claude/agents/devops-tito.md) - Infrastructure and CLI development

#### **Agent Communication Protocol:**
All agents are available via the Task tool. The TPM manages:
- **Project planning** and agent sequencing
- **Quality gates** and handoff criteria  
- **Timeline management** and progress tracking
- **Escalation** when new agents are needed
- **Integration** across all deliverables

## üéØ **Quick Slash Commands for Workflows**

**üìñ DETAILED WORKFLOWS:** See `.claude/workflows/` for complete specifications

### Available Commands:
| Command | Purpose | Workflow | Details |
|---------|---------|----------|---------|
| `/website` | Website updates | Content Strategist ‚Üí Designer | [workflow](/.claude/workflows/website.md) |
| `/module` | Module development | Developer ‚Üí QA ‚Üí Package | [workflow](/.claude/workflows/module.md) |
| `/test` | Testing | QA ‚Üí Report | [workflow](/.claude/workflows/test.md) |
| `/tito` | CLI updates | CLI Developer ‚Üí QA | [workflow](/.claude/workflows/tito.md) |
| `/education` | Educational content | Architect ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí QA | [workflow](/.claude/workflows/education.md) |

### Usage:
```
/[workflow] [your specific request]
```

### Examples:
```
/website add a debugging guide
/module fix tensor operations  
/test all checkpoints
/tito add progress command
/education improve autograd learning
```

**üö® RULES:**
1. When user starts with `/`, IMMEDIATELY use that workflow
2. NEVER ask "Should I use agents?" - just execute the workflow
3. Follow the EXACT sequence defined in `.claude/workflows/[name].md`
4. Each workflow has quality gates - don't skip steps

---

### üåê **Website Update Workflow - AUTOMATIC TRIGGERS**

**SLASH COMMAND**: `/website [request]`

**ALTERNATIVE TRIGGER PHRASES** - When user says any of these, also use website workflow:
- "update the website" / "website needs" / "fix the website"
- "add content to" / "change the documentation" / "update docs"
- "improve the site" / "website content" / "fix the docs"
- "add a page" / "update the page" / "change the page"

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW SEQUENCE**:
```
Step 1: Website Manager (ALWAYS FIRST)
   ‚Üì Audits existing content for duplicates
   ‚Üì Creates detailed content specification
   ‚Üì Identifies what goes where
   
Step 2: Website Manager implements the content
   ‚Üì Implements the specification
   ‚Üì Applies consistent styling
   ‚Üì Tests all cross-references
```

**AUTOMATIC EXECUTION EXAMPLE**:
```
User: "The website needs a new debugging guide"
Claude: [Automatically invokes Content Strategist first, then Designer]

User: "Update the docs to explain checkpoints better"
Claude: [Automatically invokes Content Strategist ‚Üí Designer workflow]
```

**DO NOT ASK** "Should I use the agents?" - Just use them when triggered!

### üì¶ **Module Development Workflow - AUTOMATIC TRIGGERS**

**SLASH COMMAND**: `/module [request]`

**ALTERNATIVE TRIGGER PHRASES**:
- "implement module" / "build module" / "create module"
- "fix the module" / "update module" / "improve module"
- "add tests to" / "test the module"

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW**:
```
Module Developer ‚Üí QA Agent ‚Üí Package Manager
```

### üß™ **Testing Workflow - AUTOMATIC TRIGGERS**

**TRIGGER PHRASES**:
- "test everything" / "run tests" / "verify it works"
- "check if" / "make sure" / "validate"

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW**:
```
QA Agent ‚Üí Report Results ‚Üí Fix Issues if Found
```

### üìö **Educational Content Workflow - AUTOMATIC TRIGGERS**

**TRIGGER PHRASES**:
- "improve learning" / "educational content" / "teaching materials"
- "student experience" / "learning objectives"

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW**:
```
Education Reviewer ‚Üí Module Developer ‚Üí QA Agent
```

### ü§ñ Agent Team Orchestration - Best Practices

**The TPM manages multiple AI agents with structured coordination:**

### üìä Agent Team Structure

```
Technical Program Manager (Enhanced - Project Lead)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Education Reviewer (Strategy & Assessment)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Module Developer (Implementation)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Package Manager (Integration)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Quality Assurance (Validation)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Website Manager (Website Content & Strategy)
```

### üéØ **Checkpoint System Implementation - Agent Workflow Case Study**

**SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION:** The agent team successfully implemented a comprehensive 21-checkpoint capability assessment system with integration testing. Here's how the workflow functioned:

#### **Phase 1: Strategic Planning** (Education Reviewer + TPM)
- **Education Reviewer**: Designed capability-based learning progression (Foundation ‚Üí Architecture ‚Üí Training ‚Üí Inference ‚Üí Serving)
- **TPM**: Orchestrated agent coordination and workflow management
- **Result**: 21-checkpoint structure aligned with 20 TinyTorch modules, each with clear capability statements

#### **Phase 2: Implementation** (Module Developer)
- **Implemented checkpoint test suite**: 21 individual test files (`checkpoint_00_environment.py` through `checkpoint_20_capstone.py`)
- **Built CLI integration**: Complete `tito checkpoint` command system with Rich visualizations
- **Created module completion workflow**: `tito module complete` with automatic export and testing
- **Added integration testing**: Post-module completion checkpoint validation
- **MUST call QA Agent**: Immediately after implementation completed

#### **Phase 3: Quality Assurance** (QA Agent) - **MANDATORY**
- **Tested all 21 checkpoint implementations**: Each test file executes correctly and validates capabilities
- **Verified CLI integration**: All `tito checkpoint` commands work with Rich progress tracking
- **Validated module completion workflow**: `tito module complete` correctly exports and tests checkpoints
- **Tested integration pipeline**: Module-to-checkpoint mapping functions correctly
- **Reported success to Package Manager**: All tests passed, ready for integration

#### **Phase 4: Package Integration** (Package Manager) - **MANDATORY**
- **Validated checkpoint test execution**: All checkpoint files import and run correctly
- **Verified CLI command registration**: `tito checkpoint` commands integrated into main CLI
- **Tested module-to-checkpoint mapping**: Correct checkpoint triggered for each module completion
- **Ensured complete package build**: All checkpoint functionality available in built package
- **Integration success confirmed**: Complete system works end-to-end

#### **Phase 5: Website Content** (Website Manager)
- **Updated documentation**: This CLAUDE.md file, checkpoint-system.md, README.md updates with design strategy
- **Documented agent workflow**: How agents successfully coordinated implementation with user experience design
- **Created CLI documentation**: Usage examples and command reference with visual hierarchy
- **Explained integration testing**: How checkpoint system validates student progress with content presentation optimization

#### **Phase 6: Review and Approval** (TPM)
- **Verified all Chen Gates passed**: QA approved, Package Manager confirmed integration through systematic workflow
- **Confirmed capability delivery**: 21-checkpoint system with CLI and integration testing using Chen State Machine
- **Approved for commit**: Complete implementation ready for production use through enhanced workflow authority

### üîÑ Standard Agent Workflow Pattern

**For EVERY module update, follow this sequence:**

1. **Planning Phase** (TPM + Education Reviewer)
   - Define learning objectives
   - Plan module structure
   - Set implementation goals

2. **Implementation Phase** (Module Developer)
   - Write code following specifications
   - Add NBGrader metadata
   - Create test scaffolding
   - Add proper export directives (#| default_exp)
   - **MUST call QA Agent when done**

3. **Testing Phase** (Quality Assurance) - **MANDATORY**
   - Run comprehensive test suite
   - Verify all functionality
   - Report results to Package Manager
   - **Block progress if tests fail**

4. **Integration Phase** (Package Manager) - **MANDATORY**
   - Validate module exports correctly
   - Check integration with other modules
   - Run integration tests
   - Ensure complete package works
   - **Block progress if integration fails**

5. **Documentation Phase** (Education Reviewer)
   - Add explanatory markdown
   - Create ML systems thinking questions
   - Ensure clarity and consistency

6. **Review Phase** (TPM)
   - Verify all agents completed their tasks
   - Ensure QA tests passed
   - Confirm package integration successful
   - Approve for commit

### üéØ Agent Communication Protocol

**Agents MUST communicate through structured handoffs:**

```python
# Example workflow for module update:
workflow_coordinator.plan_update(module="tensor")
    ‚Üí education_architect.design_learning_path()
    ‚Üí module_developer.implement_code()
    ‚Üí qa_agent.run_tests()  # MANDATORY
    ‚Üí documentation_publisher.add_documentation()
    ‚Üí workflow_coordinator.review_and_approve()
```

### ‚ö° Parallel vs Sequential Work

**Parallel Tasks (can happen simultaneously):**
- Multiple Module Developers working on different modules
- Education Reviewer preparing documentation while code is tested
- Education Reviewer planning next modules

**Sequential Tasks (must happen in order):**
- Virtual Environment Setup ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Commit
- Planning ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Documentation
- Test Failure ‚Üí Fix ‚Üí Re-test ‚Üí Proceed

### üö® Agent Accountability Rules

1. **Module Developer**: Cannot mark task complete without QA approval
2. **QA Agent**: Must test EVERY change, no exceptions
3. **Package Manager**: Must validate integration, can block releases
4. **TPM**: Cannot proceed without all agent sign-offs
5. **Education Reviewer**: Must verify code works before documenting
6. **Education Reviewer**: Must validate learning objectives are met

### üìù Agent Handoff Checklist

When passing work between agents, include:
- [ ] What was completed
- [ ] What needs to be done next
- [ ] Any issues or blockers found
- [ ] Test results (if applicable)
- [ ] Recommendations for next agent

### üîß Conflict Resolution

If agents disagree or find conflicts:
1. QA Agent has veto power on code quality
2. Education Reviewer has final say on learning objectives
3. TPM resolves all other disputes
4. User has ultimate override authority

### ü§ñ Workflow Compliance
**ALL AI agents MUST follow the Git Workflow Standards defined in `/Users/VJ/GitHub/TinyTorch/CLAUDE.md`.**

Read the complete Git Workflow Standards section in this file for all branching, commit, and merge requirements.
