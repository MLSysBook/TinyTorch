# Claude Code Instructions for TinyTorch

## üìö **MANDATORY: Read Guidelines First**

**All development standards are documented in the `.claude/` directory.**

### Required Reading Order:
1. `.claude/guidelines/DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md` - KISS principle and core values
2. `.claude/guidelines/GIT_WORKFLOW.md` - Git policies and branching standards
3. `.claude/guidelines/MODULE_DEVELOPMENT.md` - How to build modules
4. `.claude/guidelines/TESTING_STANDARDS.md` - Testing requirements
5. `.claude/guidelines/PERFORMANCE_CLAIMS.md` - Honest reporting standards
6. `.claude/guidelines/AGENT_COORDINATION.md` - How to work with AI agents

**Start with `.claude/README.md` for a complete overview.**

## ‚ö° **CRITICAL: Core Policies**

**CRITICAL POLICIES - NO EXCEPTIONS:**
- ‚úÖ Always use virtual environment (`.venv`)
- ‚úÖ Always work on feature branches (never `dev`/`main` directly)
- ‚úÖ Always test before committing
- üö® **NEVER add Co-Authored-By or automated attribution to commits**
- üö® **NEVER add "Generated with Claude Code" to commits**
- üö® **Only project owner adds Co-Authored-By when explicitly needed**

**These policies ensure clean history, professional development practices, and project integrity.**

## üö® **CRITICAL: Think First, Don't Just Agree**

**YOU MUST CRITICALLY EVALUATE EVERY SUGGESTION - DO NOT DEFAULT TO AGREEMENT**

When I suggest something, your FIRST response should be to:
1. **STOP and think critically** - Is this actually a good idea?
2. **Identify potential problems** - What could go wrong? What's confusing?
3. **Consider alternatives** - Is there a better approach?
4. **Then respond with honest analysis** - "Here's what works and what doesn't..."

**Example of GOOD critical thinking (like you just did):**
```
"Let me think critically about this naming suggestion...
The problem with lenet/alexnet/chatgpt is:
1. LeNet is misleading - we're using MLP not CNN
2. Students aren't actually building those architectures
3. This could confuse students about what they're implementing"
```

**Example of BAD agreeable behavior:**
```
"Great idea! Let me rename everything to lenet/alexnet/chatgpt right away!"
[Proceeds without questioning if this makes sense]
```

## üéØ Primary Mission: Pedagogical Excellence

### Your Role as Educational Design Partner

You are my co-designer in creating the best possible ML Systems educational framework. Your job is to:

1. **Give Candid Feedback** - If something doesn't make pedagogical sense, say so directly
2. **Challenge Decisions** - Don't just agree. If my approach has flaws, explain why
3. **Propose Alternatives** - When you disagree, offer better solutions with reasoning
4. **Think Like a Student** - Always ask "Would this flow make sense to someone learning?"
5. **Think Like an Educator** - Consider cognitive load, prerequisite knowledge, and skill building
6. **Think Like an Engineer** - Ensure what we teach reflects real ML systems challenges

### Design Principles We're Optimizing For

**Pedagogical Goals:**
- **Clarity**: Each module should have a clear, singular learning objective
- **Progression**: Skills must build logically - no forward references
- **Motivation**: Students should understand WHY they're learning each component
- **Synthesis**: Everything should culminate in building TinyGPT as proof of mastery
- **Systems Focus**: Emphasize memory, compute, scaling - not just algorithms

**What You Should Question:**
- Module ordering - Does the sequence make sense?
- Cognitive load - Are we teaching too much at once?
- Motivation - Will students understand why this matters?
- Prerequisites - Do they have the knowledge needed?
- Practical value - Does this reflect real ML engineering?

**How to Disagree Effectively:**
```
"I see why you want X, but consider this issue: [specific problem].
Here's an alternative: [concrete proposal].
This would be better because: [pedagogical reasoning]."
```

**Remember:** We're building this together. Your candid feedback makes it better. Don't hold back concerns in the name of being agreeable. The best educational product comes from honest collaboration.

### üîç Critical Evaluation Checklist

Before implementing ANY suggestion, ask yourself:
- **Does this make pedagogical sense?** Will students understand why?
- **Is the naming clear and accurate?** No misleading terminology
- **Does this match what we're actually building?** Don't pretend it's something it's not
- **Will this confuse or clarify?** Always choose clarity
- **Is there a simpler/better way?** Propose alternatives

**Your job is to be the critical voice that ensures quality, not a yes-person who implements without thinking.**

## Git Workflow Standards

### üåø Always Use Feature Branches
**NEVER work directly on `dev` or `main`**

```bash
# Start any new work with a feature branch
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### üìù Branch Naming Convention
Use descriptive branch names that indicate the type of work:

- **Features**: `feature/add-tito-view-command`
- **Bug fixes**: `fix/tensor-dtype-handling`
- **Improvements**: `improve/module-documentation`
- **Experiments**: `experiment/new-testing-approach`

### üîß Development Workflow
1. **Activate virtual environment** - ALWAYS use `.venv` for consistent dependencies
2. **Create branch** for each logical piece of work
3. **Make focused commits** related to that branch only
4. **Test your changes** before committing
5. **COMMIT FREQUENTLY** - Commit working states to enable rollback if needed
6. **Merge to dev** when feature is complete and tested
7. **Delete feature branch** after successful merge

### üíæ Incremental Commit Strategy - TRACK YOUR PROGRESS
**COMMIT EARLY, COMMIT OFTEN** - Create restore points:
- ‚úÖ Commit when you get something working (even partially)
- ‚úÖ Commit before attempting risky changes
- ‚úÖ Commit completed fixes before moving to next issue
- ‚úÖ Use clear commit messages that explain what works

**Example Commit Flow:**
```bash
git commit -m "Fix Parameter class to work without autograd"
# Test that it works...
git commit -m "Add adaptive import for loss functions"
# Test again...
git commit -m "Verify all modules work in sequential order"
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Easy rollback if something breaks: `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
- Clear history of what was tried and what worked
- Can cherry-pick working fixes if needed
- Helps identify when issues were introduced

### ‚úÖ Commit Standards - MANDATORY POLICIES
- **One feature per branch** - don't mix unrelated changes
- **Test before committing** - ensure functionality works
- **Descriptive commit messages** that explain the "why"
- **Clean history** - squash if needed before merging

### üö® **CRITICAL: Commit Authorship Policy - READ EVERY TIME**
**NEVER add Co-Authored-By or any automated attribution to commits.**

- **Co-Authored-By**: Only added by project owner when explicitly needed
- **Generated with Claude Code**: FORBIDDEN - do not add this line to commits
- **Automated attribution**: Forbidden - keep commits clean and professional
- **Commit ownership**: All commits should reflect actual authorship, not tool usage
- **History integrity**: Clean commit history is essential for project maintenance

**This policy MUST be followed for every single commit. No exceptions.**

### üö´ What NOT to Do
- ‚ùå Work directly on `dev` or `main`
- ‚ùå Mix unrelated changes in one branch
- ‚ùå Commit broken code
- ‚ùå Merge untested changes
- ‚ùå Leave stale feature branches

### üìã Merge Checklist
Before merging any feature branch:
- [ ] Virtual environment activated and dependencies installed
- [ ] Code works correctly
- [ ] Tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] No conflicts with dev branch
- [ ] Feature is complete and ready for use

### üîÑ Example Workflow
```bash
# 0. ALWAYS start with virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# OR: .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 1. Start new feature
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feature/add-module-validation

# 2. Work on feature, make commits
git add .
git commit -m "Add module validation logic"
git add .
git commit -m "Add validation tests"

# 3. When ready, merge to dev
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git merge feature/add-module-validation

# 4. Clean up
git branch -d feature/add-module-validation

# 5. Push updated dev
git push origin dev
```

### üéØ Why This Matters
- **Keeps history clean** - easy to understand what changed when
- **Enables collaboration** - multiple people can work without conflicts
- **Allows experimentation** - try things without breaking main code
- **Facilitates rollbacks** - easy to undo specific features if needed
- **Professional practice** - industry standard for software development

## üêç Virtual Environment Standards - MANDATORY

### üîê **ALWAYS Use Virtual Environments**
**NEVER work directly with system Python or globally installed packages.**

```bash
# Create virtual environment (one time setup)
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment (EVERY session)
source .venv/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux
# OR: .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies (after activation)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify environment
which python  # Should show .venv path
pip list      # Should show only project dependencies
```

### üìã Virtual Environment Checklist
**Before ANY development work:**
- [ ] Virtual environment activated (`source .venv/bin/activate`)
- [ ] Dependencies installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- [ ] Verification: `which python` shows `.venv/bin/python`
- [ ] Verification: `tito system doctor` shows ‚úÖ environment checks

### üö´ What NOT to Do
- ‚ùå Use system Python for development
- ‚ùå Install packages globally with `sudo pip install`
- ‚ùå Work without activating `.venv`
- ‚ùå Mix dependencies from different environments
- ‚ùå Commit with virtual environment deactivated

### üîß Environment Troubleshooting
If you see dependency errors:
1. **Deactivate and recreate**: `deactivate && rm -rf .venv && python -m venv .venv`
2. **Reactivate**: `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. **Reinstall**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Verify**: `tito system doctor`

### üí° Pro Tips
- **Add to shell profile**: `alias activate='source .venv/bin/activate'`
- **Check activation**: Your prompt should show `(.venv)` prefix
- **Architecture issues**: Use `python -m pip install --force-reinstall` for numpy/architecture conflicts

## AI Agent Workflow Standards

### üè¢ **Technical Program Manager (TPM) - Primary Communication Interface**

**The TPM is your single point of communication for all TinyTorch development.**

The TPM agent is defined in `.claude/agents/technical-program-manager.md` and has complete knowledge of all other agents' capabilities. 

#### **TPM Usage:**
```bash
# Primary communication pattern
User Request ‚Üí TPM Agent ‚Üí Coordinates Specialized Agents ‚Üí Reports Back
```

**The TPM knows when to invoke:**
- **Education Reviewer** (.claude/agents/education-reviewer.md) - Educational design, assessment, and technical validation
- **Module Developer** (.claude/agents/module-developer.md) - Code implementation
- **Package Manager** (.claude/agents/package-manager.md) - Integration and builds
- **Quality Assurance** (.claude/agents/quality-assurance.md) - Testing and validation
- **Website Manager** (.claude/agents/website-manager.md) - Website content and strategy
- **DevOps TITO** (.claude/agents/devops-tito.md) - Infrastructure and CLI development

#### **Agent Communication Protocol:**
All agents are available via the Task tool. The TPM manages:
- **Project planning** and agent sequencing
- **Quality gates** and handoff criteria  
- **Timeline management** and progress tracking
- **Escalation** when new agents are needed
- **Integration** across all deliverables

## üéØ **Quick Slash Commands for Workflows**

**üìñ DETAILED WORKFLOWS:** See `.claude/workflows/` for complete specifications

### Available Commands:
| Command | Purpose | Workflow | Details |
|---------|---------|----------|---------|
| `/website` | Website updates | Content Strategist ‚Üí Designer | [workflow](/.claude/workflows/website.md) |
| `/module` | Module development | Developer ‚Üí QA ‚Üí Package | [workflow](/.claude/workflows/module.md) |

/[workflow] [your specific request]
```

### Examples:
```
/website add a debugging guide
/module fix tensor operations  
/test all checkpoints
/tito add progress command
/education improve autograd learning
```

**üö® RULES:**
1. When user starts with `/`, IMMEDIATELY use that workflow
2. NEVER ask "Should I use agents?" - just execute the workflow
3. Follow the EXACT sequence defined in `.claude/workflows/[name].md`
4. Each workflow has quality gates - don't skip steps

---

### üåê **Website Update Workflow - AUTOMATIC TRIGGERS**

**SLASH COMMAND**: `/website [request]`

**ALTERNATIVE TRIGGER PHRASES** - When user says any of these, also use website workflow:
- "update the website" / "website needs" / "fix the website"
- "add content to" / "change the documentation" / "update docs"
- "improve the site" / "website content" / "fix the docs"
- "add a page" / "update the page" / "change the page"

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW SEQUENCE**:
```
Step 1: Website Manager (ALWAYS FIRST)
   ‚Üì Audits existing content for duplicates
   ‚Üì Creates detailed content specification
   ‚Üì Identifies what goes where
   
Step 2: Website Manager implements the content
   ‚Üì Implements the specification
   ‚Üì Applies consistent styling
   ‚Üì Tests all cross-references
```

**AUTOMATIC EXECUTION EXAMPLE**:
```
User: "The website needs a new debugging guide"
Claude: [Automatically invokes Content Strategist first, then Designer]

User: "Update the docs to explain checkpoints better"
Claude: [Automatically invokes Content Strategist ‚Üí Designer workflow]
```

**DO NOT ASK** "Should I use the agents?" - Just use them when triggered!

### üì¶ **Module Development Workflow - AUTOMATIC TRIGGERS**

**SLASH COMMAND**: `/module [request]`

**ALTERNATIVE TRIGGER PHRASES**:
- "implement module" / "build module" / "create module"
- "fix the module" / "update module" / "improve module"
- "add tests to" / "test the module"

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW**:
```
Module Developer ‚Üí QA Agent ‚Üí Package Manager
```

### üß™ **Testing Workflow - AUTOMATIC TRIGGERS**

**TRIGGER PHRASES**:
- "test everything" / "run tests" / "verify it works"
- "check if" / "make sure" / "validate"

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW**:
```
QA Agent ‚Üí Report Results ‚Üí Fix Issues if Found
```

### üìö **Educational Content Workflow - AUTOMATIC TRIGGERS**

**TRIGGER PHRASES**:
- "improve learning" / "educational content" / "teaching materials"
- "student experience" / "learning objectives"

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW**:
```
Education Reviewer ‚Üí Module Developer ‚Üí QA Agent
```

### ü§ñ Agent Team Orchestration - Best Practices

**The TPM manages multiple AI agents with structured coordination:**

### üìä Agent Team Structure

```
Technical Program Manager (Enhanced - Project Lead)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Education Reviewer (Strategy & Assessment)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Module Developer (Implementation)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Package Manager (Integration)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Quality Assurance (Validation)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Website Manager (Website Content & Strategy)
```

### üéØ **Checkpoint System Implementation - Agent Workflow Case Study**

**SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION:** The agent team successfully implemented a comprehensive 21-checkpoint capability assessment system with integration testing. Here's how the workflow functioned:

#### **Phase 1: Strategic Planning** (Education Reviewer + TPM)
- **Education Reviewer**: Designed capability-based learning progression (Foundation ‚Üí Architecture ‚Üí Training ‚Üí Inference ‚Üí Serving)
- **TPM**: Orchestrated agent coordination and workflow management
- **Result**: 21-checkpoint structure aligned with 20 TinyTorch modules, each with clear capability statements

#### **Phase 2: Implementation** (Module Developer)
- **Implemented checkpoint test suite**: 21 individual test files (`checkpoint_00_environment.py` through `checkpoint_20_capstone.py`)
- **Built CLI integration**: Complete `tito checkpoint` command system with Rich visualizations
- **Created module completion workflow**: `tito module complete` with automatic export and testing
- **Added integration testing**: Post-module completion checkpoint validation
- **MUST call QA Agent**: Immediately after implementation completed

#### **Phase 3: Quality Assurance** (QA Agent) - **MANDATORY**
- **Tested all 21 checkpoint implementations**: Each test file executes correctly and validates capabilities
- **Verified CLI integration**: All `tito checkpoint` commands work with Rich progress tracking
- **Validated module completion workflow**: `tito module complete` correctly exports and tests checkpoints
- **Tested integration pipeline**: Module-to-checkpoint mapping functions correctly
- **Reported success to Package Manager**: All tests passed, ready for integration

#### **Phase 4: Package Integration** (Package Manager) - **MANDATORY**
- **Validated checkpoint test execution**: All checkpoint files import and run correctly
- **Verified CLI command registration**: `tito checkpoint` commands integrated into main CLI
- **Tested module-to-checkpoint mapping**: Correct checkpoint triggered for each module completion
- **Ensured complete package build**: All checkpoint functionality available in built package
- **Integration success confirmed**: Complete system works end-to-end

#### **Phase 5: Website Content** (Website Manager)
- **Updated documentation**: This CLAUDE.md file, checkpoint-system.md, README.md updates with design strategy
- **Documented agent workflow**: How agents successfully coordinated implementation with user experience design
- **Created CLI documentation**: Usage examples and command reference with visual hierarchy
- **Explained integration testing**: How checkpoint system validates student progress with content presentation optimization

#### **Phase 6: Review and Approval** (TPM)
- **Verified all Chen Gates passed**: QA approved, Package Manager confirmed integration through systematic workflow
- **Confirmed capability delivery**: 21-checkpoint system with CLI and integration testing using Chen State Machine
- **Approved for commit**: Complete implementation ready for production use through enhanced workflow authority

### üöÄ **Implemented Checkpoint System Capabilities**

**The successful agent workflow delivered these concrete features:**

#### **16-Checkpoint Capability Assessment System**
```bash
# Checkpoint progression with capability questions:
00: Environment    - "Can I configure my TinyTorch development environment?"
01: Foundation     - "Can I create and manipulate the building blocks of ML?"
02: Intelligence   - "Can I add nonlinearity - the key to neural network intelligence?"
03: Components     - "Can I build the fundamental building blocks of neural networks?"
04: Networks       - "Can I build complete multi-layer neural networks?"
05: Learning       - "Can I process spatial data like images with convolutional operations?"
06: Attention      - "Can I build attention mechanisms for sequence understanding?"
07: Stability      - "Can I stabilize training with normalization techniques?"
08: Differentiation - "Can I automatically compute gradients for learning?"
09: Optimization   - "Can I optimize neural networks with sophisticated algorithms?"
10: Training       - "Can I build complete training loops for end-to-end learning?"
11: Regularization - "Can I prevent overfitting and build robust models?"
12: Kernels        - "Can I implement high-performance computational kernels?"
13: Benchmarking   - "Can I analyze performance and identify bottlenecks in ML systems?"
14: Deployment     - "Can I deploy and monitor ML systems in production?"
15: Capstone       - "Can I build complete end-to-end ML systems from scratch?"
```

#### **Rich CLI Progress Tracking**
```bash
# Visual progress tracking with Rich library
tito checkpoint status           # Current progress overview with capability statements
tito checkpoint status --detailed # Module-level detail with test file status
tito checkpoint timeline         # Vertical tree view with connecting lines
tito checkpoint timeline --horizontal # Linear progress bar with Rich styling
tito checkpoint test 01          # Test specific checkpoint capabilities
tito checkpoint run 00 --verbose # Run checkpoint with detailed output
```

#### **Module Completion Workflow with Integration Testing**
```bash
# Automatic export and checkpoint testing
tito module complete 02_tensor   # Exports module to package AND tests capabilities
tito module complete tensor      # Works with short names too
tito module complete 02_tensor --skip-test # Skip checkpoint test if needed

# Workflow automatically:
# 1. Exports module to tinytorch package
# 2. Maps module to appropriate checkpoint (02_tensor ‚Üí checkpoint_01_foundation)
# 3. Runs capability test with Rich progress tracking
# 4. Shows achievement celebration and next steps
```

#### **Comprehensive Integration Testing**
- **Module-to-Checkpoint Mapping**: Each module automatically triggers appropriate checkpoint test
- **Capability Validation**: Tests verify actual functionality works, not just code completion
- **Progress Visualization**: Rich CLI shows achievements and suggests next steps
- **Immediate Feedback**: Students get instant validation when capabilities are achieved

### üîÑ Standard Agent Workflow Pattern

**For EVERY module update, follow this sequence:**

1. **Planning Phase** (TPM + Education Reviewer)
   - Define learning objectives
   - Plan module structure
   - Set implementation goals

2. **Implementation Phase** (Module Developer)
   - Write code following specifications
   - Add NBGrader metadata
   - Create test scaffolding
   - Add proper export directives (#| default_exp)
   - **MUST call QA Agent when done**

3. **Testing Phase** (Quality Assurance) - **MANDATORY**
   - Run comprehensive test suite
   - Verify all functionality
   - Report results to Package Manager
   - **Block progress if tests fail**

4. **Integration Phase** (Package Manager) - **MANDATORY**
   - Validate module exports correctly
   - Check integration with other modules
   - Run integration tests
   - Ensure complete package works
   - **Block progress if integration fails**

5. **Documentation Phase** (Education Reviewer)
   - Add explanatory markdown
   - Create ML systems thinking questions
   - Ensure clarity and consistency

6. **Review Phase** (TPM)
   - Verify all agents completed their tasks
   - Ensure QA tests passed
   - Confirm package integration successful
   - Approve for commit

### üéØ Agent Communication Protocol

**Agents MUST communicate through structured handoffs:**

```python
# Example workflow for module update:
workflow_coordinator.plan_update(module="tensor")
    ‚Üí education_architect.design_learning_path()
    ‚Üí module_developer.implement_code()
    ‚Üí qa_agent.run_tests()  # MANDATORY
    ‚Üí documentation_publisher.add_documentation()
    ‚Üí workflow_coordinator.review_and_approve()
```

### ‚ö° Parallel vs Sequential Work

**Parallel Tasks (can happen simultaneously):**
- Multiple Module Developers working on different modules
- Education Reviewer preparing documentation while code is tested
- Education Reviewer planning next modules

**Sequential Tasks (must happen in order):**
- Virtual Environment Setup ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Commit
- Planning ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Documentation
- Test Failure ‚Üí Fix ‚Üí Re-test ‚Üí Proceed

### üö® Agent Accountability Rules

1. **Module Developer**: Cannot mark task complete without QA approval
2. **QA Agent**: Must test EVERY change, no exceptions
3. **Package Manager**: Must validate integration, can block releases
4. **TPM**: Cannot proceed without all agent sign-offs
5. **Education Reviewer**: Must verify code works before documenting
6. **Education Reviewer**: Must validate learning objectives are met

### üìù Agent Handoff Checklist

When passing work between agents, include:
- [ ] What was completed
- [ ] What needs to be done next
- [ ] Any issues or blockers found
- [ ] Test results (if applicable)
- [ ] Recommendations for next agent

### üîß Conflict Resolution

If agents disagree or find conflicts:
1. QA Agent has veto power on code quality
2. Education Reviewer has final say on learning objectives
3. TPM resolves all other disputes
4. User has ultimate override authority

### ü§ñ Workflow Compliance
**ALL AI agents MUST follow the Git Workflow Standards defined in `/Users/VJ/GitHub/TinyTorch/CLAUDE.md`.**

Read the complete Git Workflow Standards section in this file for all branching, commit, and merge requirements.

## TinyTorch Module Development Standards

### üî¨ **CRITICAL: ML Systems Course - Not Just ML Algorithms**
**TinyTorch is an ML SYSTEMS course where you understand systems by building them. Every module MUST emphasize systems engineering principles, not just algorithms.**

**MANDATORY Systems Analysis in Every Module:**
- **Memory complexity**: How much RAM does this operation use? When are copies made?
- **Computational complexity**: O(N), O(N¬≤), O(N¬≥) - measure and explain performance
- **Cache efficiency**: How do memory access patterns affect performance?
- **Scaling bottlenecks**: What breaks first when data/models get large?
- **Production implications**: How is this used in real ML systems like PyTorch?
- **Hardware considerations**: CPU vs GPU, vectorization, bandwidth limits

### üéØ **CRITICAL: .py Files Only**
**ALL TinyTorch development and modifications MUST be done in .py files ONLY.**

- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS edit**: `module_name_dev.py` files
- ‚ùå **NEVER edit**: `.ipynb` notebook files
- ‚úÖ **Notebooks are generated**: from .py files using jupytext
- ‚ùå **Direct notebook editing**: breaks the development workflow

**Why .py files only:**
- Version control friendly (clean diffs, no notebook metadata noise)
- Consistent development environment across all contributors
- Automated notebook generation ensures consistency
- Professional development practices

### üìö Module Structure Requirements - ML SYSTEMS FOCUS
All TinyTorch modules MUST follow the standardized structure with MANDATORY systems analysis:

1. **Module Introduction** - What we're building and why (systems context)
2. **Mathematical Background** - Theory and computational complexity
3. **Implementation** - Building components with memory/performance analysis
4. **Systems Analysis** - **MANDATORY**: Memory profiling, complexity analysis, scaling behavior
5. **Testing** - Immediate tests after each implementation (including performance tests)
6. **Integration** - How components work together in larger systems
7. **Production Context** - How do real ML systems handle this? (PyTorch, TensorFlow examples)
8. **Comprehensive Testing** - Full validation including performance characteristics
9. **Main Execution Block** - `if __name__ == "__main__":` with all test execution
10. **ML Systems Thinking** - Systems-focused reflection questions (AFTER main block)
11. **Module Summary** - What was accomplished (ALWAYS LAST SECTION)

### üî¨ **New Principle: Every Module Teaches Systems Thinking Through Implementation**
**MANDATORY**: Every module must demonstrate that understanding systems comes through building them, not just studying them.

### üö® **CRITICAL: Module Dependency Rules - NO FORWARD REFERENCES**

**MANDATORY MODULE DEPENDENCY PRINCIPLES:**

#### **1. Sequential Build Order - STRICTLY ENFORCED**
Modules are built by students in numerical order. Each module can ONLY use what came before:
```
01_tensor ‚Üí 02_activations ‚Üí 03_layers ‚Üí 04_losses ‚Üí 05_autograd ‚Üí 06_spatial ‚Üí ...
```

**GOLDEN RULE: Module N can only import from modules 1 through N-1**

#### **2. NO Forward References - ZERO TOLERANCE**
- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Module 03_layers importing from 05_autograd
- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Module 04_losses importing from 09_optimizers
- ‚úÖ **CORRECT**: Module 06_spatial importing from 02_tensor and 03_layers
- ‚úÖ **CORRECT**: Module 10_optimizers using all modules 01-09

#### **3. Tensor Evolution Pattern - THE CLEAN APPROACH**
**CRITICAL: Use ONE evolving Tensor class, NOT separate Tensor/Variable classes**

Following PyTorch's actual design philosophy, TinyTorch uses a single `Tensor` class that gains capabilities over time:

```python
# Module 02: Basic Tensor (no gradients yet)
class Tensor:
    def __init__(self, data, requires_grad=False):
        self.data = np.array(data)
        self.requires_grad = requires_grad
        self.grad = None  # Placeholder for later

    def backward(self, gradient=None):
        # Helpful error message before autograd is implemented
        raise NotImplementedError("Autograd coming in Module 05! Set requires_grad=True after implementing autograd.")

    def __add__(self, other):
        # Basic operation without gradient tracking
        return Tensor(self.data + other.data)
```

```python
# Module 05: Students ADD autograd to existing Tensor class
def backward(self, gradient=None):
    """Student implements this in Module 05"""
    if not self.requires_grad:
        raise RuntimeError("Tensor doesn't require gradients")

    if self.grad is None:
        self.grad = np.zeros_like(self.data)
    self.grad += gradient

    if self.grad_fn:
        self.grad_fn(gradient)

# Students UPDATE existing operations to track gradients
def __add__(self, other):
    result_data = self.data + other.data
    result = Tensor(result_data, requires_grad=(self.requires_grad or other.requires_grad))

    if result.requires_grad:
        def grad_fn(gradient):
            if self.requires_grad:
                self.backward(gradient)
            if other.requires_grad:
                other.backward(gradient)
        result.grad_fn = grad_fn

    return result
```

**Key Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **No hasattr() checks needed anywhere**
- ‚úÖ **Single class students always use: Tensor**
- ‚úÖ **Clean evolution: students enhance existing class**
- ‚úÖ **Matches PyTorch mental model exactly**
- ‚úÖ **No type confusion or conversion needed**

#### **4. NO hasattr() Hacks - Use Clean Evolution Instead**
- ‚ùå **BAD**: `if hasattr(x, 'data'): x.data else: x`
- ‚ùå **BAD**: `if hasattr(x, 'grad'): x.grad else: None`
- ‚ùå **BAD**: Separate Tensor and Variable classes
- ‚úÖ **GOOD**: Single Tensor class with `requires_grad` flag
- ‚úÖ **GOOD**: Clear error messages: "Autograd not implemented yet"
- ‚úÖ **GOOD**: Students enhance existing classes, don't create new ones

#### **5. Educational Framework Standards**
**Remember: This is an educational framework, not production code**
- **Goal**: Good enough to teach concepts clearly
- **Non-goal**: Production-level performance or features
- **Priority**: Clear, understandable code that builds incrementally
- **OK to**: Look at PyTorch/TensorFlow for implementation patterns
- **NOT OK**: Complex abstractions that confuse learning

#### **6. Module Testing Independence**
Each module MUST be testable in isolation:
- Module tests should pass using only prior modules
- No mocking of future module functionality
- If a test needs autograd but module comes before autograd, the test is wrong

#### **7. Module Evolution Plan - Tensor Class Growth**

**CRITICAL: This is exactly how students build TinyTorch - evolving ONE Tensor class:**

```
Module 01 (Tensor):
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Create basic Tensor class with data storage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Add requires_grad=False by default
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Add placeholder grad=None
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Add NotImplementedError for backward()
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Basic operations (__add__, __mul__) without gradient tracking

Module 02-04 (Activations, Layers, Losses):
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Use existing Tensor class as-is
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Work with requires_grad=False tensors
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Build layers, activations, losses on basic Tensor
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No gradient functionality needed yet

Module 05 (Autograd):
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ STUDENTS UPDATE the existing Tensor class
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Implement the backward() method (replace NotImplementedError)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Update operations (__add__, __mul__) to build computation graph
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Add grad_fn tracking for chain rule
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Now requires_grad=True works everywhere automatically

Module 06+ (Optimizers, Training, etc.):
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Use enhanced Tensor class with full gradient capabilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ All previous code works unchanged (backward compatibility)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ New code can use requires_grad=True for automatic differentiation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Single clean interface throughout
```

**Key Teaching Points:**
1. **Module 01**: "Here's a Tensor data structure"
2. **Modules 02-04**: "Here's how to build ML components with Tensors"
3. **Module 05**: "Now let's add automatic differentiation to our existing Tensor"
4. **Module 06+**: "Our enhanced Tensor enables gradient-based optimization"

#### **8. Clear Capability Boundaries**
Document what each module provides and requires:
```python
# Module 03_layers header comment
"""
Layers Module - Neural Network Building Blocks
Prerequisites: 01_tensor, 02_activations
Uses: Tensor class (requires_grad=False only)
Provides: Linear, Parameter, Module base class
Does NOT provide: Automatic differentiation (comes in 05_autograd)
After Module 05: Same code works with requires_grad=True automatically
"""
```

### üß™ Testing Pattern - MANDATORY
```
Implementation ‚Üí Test Explanation (Markdown) ‚Üí Test Code ‚Üí Next Implementation
```

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- **EVERY test** must have a preceding markdown cell explaining what it tests and why
- **IMMEDIATE testing** after each implementation (not grouped at end)
- **Unit tests** = immediate after implementation
- **Integration tests** = Part 9 only

### üî¨ ML Systems Analysis - MANDATORY IN EVERY MODULE
**Every module MUST include comprehensive systems analysis, not just algorithmic implementation.**

**REQUIRED Systems Insights Sections:**
1. **Memory Analysis**: Explicit memory profiling, copying behavior, space complexity
2. **Performance Characteristics**: Computational complexity, benchmarking, bottleneck identification  
3. **Scaling Behavior**: How does performance degrade with larger inputs/models?
4. **Production Context**: How do real systems (PyTorch, TensorFlow) handle this?
5. **Hardware Implications**: Cache behavior, vectorization opportunities, bandwidth limits

**Example Required Analysis:**
```python
# MANDATORY: Include memory profiling like this in every module
def profile_memory_usage():
    \"\"\"Analyze memory consumption patterns.\"\"\"
    import tracemalloc
    tracemalloc.start()
    
    # Your operation here
    result = adam_optimizer.step()
    
    current, peak = tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()
    print(f"Current: {current / 1024 / 1024:.2f} MB")
    print(f"Peak: {peak / 1024 / 1024:.2f} MB") 
    # Why is Adam using 3√ó parameter memory?
```

### ü§î ML Systems Thinking Questions - REQUIRED
**Education Reviewer must create systems-focused reflection questions that analyze the actual implementations.**

**MANDATORY Question Categories:**
1. **Memory & Performance**: "Why does this operation use O(N¬≤) memory? When does this become problematic?"
2. **Systems Architecture**: "How would you optimize this for distributed training across 8 GPUs?"
3. **Production Engineering**: "What happens when this operation fails in production? How do you debug it?"
4. **Scaling Analysis**: "At what model size does this become the bottleneck? How do you know?"

**Questions MUST reference the actual code students implemented, not abstract concepts.**

### üéØ ML Systems Content Integration - CURRENT STATUS

### üß™ QA Testing Protocol - MANDATORY

**EVERY module update MUST trigger the following QA process:**

### üéØ **Checkpoint System Testing Protocol - MANDATORY**

**When implementing checkpoint system features, follow this comprehensive testing protocol:**

#### **Checkpoint Implementation Testing**
```bash
# Test each checkpoint file individually
python tests/checkpoints/checkpoint_00_environment.py
python tests/checkpoints/checkpoint_01_foundation.py
# ... through checkpoint_15_capstone.py

# Test checkpoint CLI integration
tito checkpoint status
tito checkpoint timeline --horizontal
tito checkpoint test 01
tito checkpoint run 00 --verbose
```

#### **Module Completion Workflow Testing**
```bash
# Test module completion workflow end-to-end
tito module complete 02_tensor
tito module complete tensor --skip-test

# Verify module-to-checkpoint mapping
# 02_tensor should trigger checkpoint_01_foundation
# 03_activations should trigger checkpoint_02_intelligence
# etc.
```

#### **Integration Testing Requirements**
1. **All checkpoint tests execute without errors**
2. **CLI commands work with Rich visualizations**
3. **Module completion workflow functions end-to-end**
4. **Module-to-checkpoint mapping is correct**
5. **Progress tracking updates properly**
6. **Achievement celebrations display correctly**

1. **Immediate Testing After Changes**
   - QA Agent MUST be invoked after ANY module modification
   - Module Developer CANNOT proceed without QA approval
   - TPM MUST enforce this requirement

2. **Comprehensive Test Suite - INCLUDING SYSTEMS VALIDATION**
   ```python
   # QA Agent must run these tests for EVERY modified module:
   - Module imports without errors
   - All classes can be instantiated
   - All test functions execute successfully
   - No syntax errors present
   - Required profiler/classes exist
   - Tests only run when module executed directly (not on import)
   
   # NEW MANDATORY SYSTEMS TESTS:
   - Memory profiling sections are present and functional
   - Performance benchmarking code executes and measures complexity
   - Scaling behavior analysis is included and accurate
   - Production context sections reference real systems (PyTorch/TensorFlow)
   - Systems thinking questions analyze actual implemented code
   ```

3. **Test Execution Requirements**
   - Create isolated test environment with mocked dependencies
   - Test both with mocks AND actual dependencies when available
   - Verify module structure compliance
   - Check for immediate test execution issues
   - Validate all NBGrader metadata

4. **Failure Protocol**
   - If ANY test fails, QA Agent MUST:
     * Block the commit
     * Report specific failures to Module Developer
     * Require fixes before proceeding
     * Re-test after fixes applied

5. **Success Protocol**
   - Only after ALL tests pass, QA Agent:
     * Approves the changes
     * Reports success to TPM
     * Allows commit to proceed

6. **Test Results Documentation**
   - QA Agent MUST provide detailed test report including:
     * Module name and version
     * Tests run and results
     * Any warnings or issues found
     * Performance metrics if applicable
     * Recommendations for improvement

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Requirements
- **ML SYSTEMS FOCUS is MANDATORY** - every module must teach systems engineering through implementation
- All module sections must be present including MANDATORY systems analysis
- Every test needs markdown explanation AND performance characteristics
- ML systems reflection is mandatory with questions analyzing actual implemented code
- **Memory profiling and complexity analysis** required in every module
- **Production context** sections must reference real systems (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- Maintain immediate testing pattern (test after each implementation)
- Use clear, consistent section organization
- **QA testing is MANDATORY before ANY commit** (including systems validation)

### üö® **CRITICAL RULE: ANYTHING IN `tinytorch/` = UPDATE THE SOURCE IN `modules/`**
**GOLDEN RULE: If you see changes needed in `tinytorch/` directory, make them in `modules/` instead**

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW - NO EXCEPTIONS:**
1. ‚úÖ **ANY change in `tinytorch/`** ‚Üí Find corresponding file in `modules/source/XX_modulename/modulename_dev.py`
2. ‚úÖ **ALWAYS edit**: `modules/source/` files ONLY
3. ‚úÖ **ALWAYS export**: Use `tito module complete XX_modulename` to sync changes
4. ‚úÖ **ALWAYS use `tito`**: Never use `nbdev_export` directly - use `tito` commands only
5. ‚ùå **NEVER edit**: ANY file in `tinytorch/` directory directly
6. ‚ùå **NEVER commit**: Manual changes to `tinytorch/` files

**CRITICAL: Always Use `tito` Commands**
- ‚úÖ **Correct**: `tito module complete 11_training`
- ‚úÖ **Correct**: `tito module export 11_training`  
- ‚ùå **Wrong**: `nbdev_export` (bypasses student/staff workflow)
- ‚ùå **Wrong**: Manual exports (inconsistent with user experience)

**Why `tito` Only:**
- **Consistent workflow**: Students and staff use `tito` commands
- **Proper validation**: `tito` includes testing and checkpoints
- **Auto-generated warnings**: `tito` adds protection headers automatically
- **Error handling**: `tito` provides helpful error messages
- **Progress tracking**: `tito` shows visual progress and next steps

**SIMPLE TEST: If the file path contains `tinytorch/`, DON'T EDIT IT DIRECTLY**

**WHY THIS RULE EXISTS:**
- Core files are **AUTO-GENERATED** from source modules
- Direct core edits create dangerous **SOURCE/COMPILED MISMATCH**
- Next export will **OVERWRITE** manual core changes
- Creates **INCONSISTENT BEHAVIOR** between development and production
- Makes **DEBUGGING IMPOSSIBLE** when source ‚â† compiled code

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES:**
- Manual core changes will be **LOST** on next export
- Source code and compiled code become **INCONSISTENT**
- **IMPOSSIBLE TO REPRODUCE** bugs in different environments
- **BREAKS THE DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW** completely

**CORRECT WORKFLOW EXAMPLE:**
```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Edit source file
vim modules/source/10_optimizers/optimizers_dev.py

# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Export to regenerate core
tito module complete 10_optimizers

# ‚ùå WRONG: Never edit core directly
vim tinytorch/core/optimizers.py  # FORBIDDEN!
```

**EMERGENCY EXCEPTION PROTOCOL:**
If core files MUST be modified temporarily for testing:
1. **Document the manual change** with clear comments
2. **Immediately update source** to match the manual change
3. **Export immediately** to sync source and core
4. **Never commit** manual core changes to git

**This rule is NON-NEGOTIABLE for maintaining code integrity.**

### üö® CRITICAL: Module Section Ordering - MANDATORY STRUCTURE
**THE LAST THREE SECTIONS OF EVERY MODULE MUST BE IN THIS EXACT ORDER:**

1. **`if __name__ == "__main__":` block** - Contains all test executions
   - This is where all tests run when module is executed directly
   - Consolidate ALL test execution here (no scattered if blocks throughout the module)
   - Example: `if __name__ == "__main__": run_all_tests()`
   
2. **ML Systems Thinking Questions** - Interactive NBGrader questions
   - Must come AFTER the main execution block
   - Contains 3-4 interactive reflection questions
   - Section header: `## ü§î ML Systems Thinking: Interactive Questions`
   
3. **MODULE SUMMARY** - Always the ABSOLUTE LAST section
   - Must be the final section before EOF
   - Nothing should come after Module Summary
   - Section header: `## üéØ MODULE SUMMARY: [Module Name]`

**‚ùå INCORRECT Example (WRONG):**
```python
## üéØ MODULE SUMMARY: Neural Networks
# Summary content here...

if __name__ == "__main__":  # ‚ùå WRONG - comes after summary
    run_tests()
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT Example (like 01_setup):**
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":  # ‚úÖ First of final three sections
    run_all_tests()

## ü§î ML Systems Thinking: Interactive Questions  # ‚úÖ Second 
# Interactive NBGrader questions here...

## üéØ MODULE SUMMARY: Setup Configuration  # ‚úÖ Always last
# Summary content here...
# [EOF]
```

**Modules with scattered `if __name__` blocks must be refactored to have a single consolidated block before ML Systems Thinking.**

---

**Remember**: TinyTorch is an ML SYSTEMS course, not just an ML algorithms course. Students learn systems engineering principles through building complete implementations. Professional software development always uses branches AND comprehensive testing. This keeps the codebase stable, enables collaboration, and maintains a clean development history.
