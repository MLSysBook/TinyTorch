## 🚀 **How to Run These Examples**

### **Prerequisites Check**
```bash
# 1. Verify your TinyTorch installation
tito system doctor

# 2. Check which modules you've completed  
tito checkpoint status

# 3. Ensure you're in the project root
cd /path/to/TinyTorch

### **Dataset Management (Automatic)**
**Don't worry about data logistics!** Each example automatically handles dataset downloading:

- **MNIST**: Downloads from official LeCun server (~60MB)
- **CIFAR-10**: Downloads from University of Toronto (~170MB)
- **XOR/Perceptron**: Generates synthetic data instantly

**First run will download data, subsequent runs use cached data.**

### **Running Examples by Module Completion**

### **🚫 Troubleshooting Common Issues**

cd /path/to/TinyTorch
python -m pip install -e .

# Or run with explicit path
PYTHONPATH=/path/to/TinyTorch python examples/perceptron_1957/rosenblatt_perceptron.py
```

#### **Dataset Download Issues**
```bash
# Manual dataset download if automatic fails
python examples/data_manager.py  # Test all datasets

# Or download specific datasets
python -c "from examples.data_manager import DatasetManager; DatasetManager().get_mnist()"
```

#### **Memory Issues**
```bash
# Reduce batch size for limited memory
python examples/cifar_cnn_modern/train_cnn.py --batch-size 16

# Use test mode for architecture validation only
python examples/mnist_mlp_1986/train_mlp.py --test-only
```

#### **Slow Training**
```bash
# Quick demo mode (reduced epochs)
python examples/mnist_mlp_1986/train_mlp.py --demo-mode

# Use pre-trained weights for instant results
python examples/mnist_mlp_1986/train_mlp.py --use-pretrained
