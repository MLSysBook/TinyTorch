## Option 1: Remove + Renumber (Clean but Breaking)

```
CORE FOUNDATION
├─ 01. Tensor
├─ 02. Activations
├─ 03. Layers
├─ 04. Losses
├─ 05. Autograd
└─ 06. Optimizers
    └─ 🏆 Milestones 01-03

VISION PATH
├─ 07. DataLoader       [RENAMED from 08]
└─ 08. Spatial          [RENAMED from 09]
    └─ 🏆 Milestone 04

LANGUAGE PATH
├─ 09. Tokenization     [RENAMED from 10]
├─ 10. Embeddings       [RENAMED from 11]
├─ 11. Attention        [RENAMED from 12]

```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Clean sequential numbering
- ✅ No confusing gaps
- ✅ Clear progression

**Cons:**
- ❌ Breaks all existing imports
- ❌ Breaks student checkpoints/progress
- ❌ Massive refactoring (13 module renames!)
- ❌ Git history becomes confusing
- ❌ Documentation nightmare
- ❌ Breaking change for any students mid-course

---

## Option 2: Keep Numbering + Mark 07 as Optional (Stable)

```
CORE FOUNDATION
├─ 01. Tensor
├─ 02. Activations
├─ 03. Layers
├─ 04. Losses
├─ 05. Autograd
└─ 06. Optimizers
    └─ 🏆 Milestones 01-03 (Manual training loops)

[07. Training Abstractions] - OPTIONAL ADVANCED MODULE ⭐
    → Skip this in core progression
    → Come back after completing all milestones
    → Learn PyTorch Lightning patterns
    → Understand when/why to abstract

VISION PATH
├─ 08. DataLoader       [Keep number]
└─ 09. Spatial          [Keep number]
    └─ 🏆 Milestone 04

LANGUAGE PATH
├─ 10. Tokenization     [Keep number]
├─ 11. Embeddings       [Keep number]
├─ 12. Attention        [Keep number]
└─ 13. Transformers     [Keep number]
    └─ 🏆 Milestone 05

ADVANCED SYSTEMS
├─ 14. KV-Caching       [Keep number]
├─ 15. Profiling        [Keep number]
├─ 16. Acceleration     [Keep number]
├─ 17. Quantization     [Keep number]
├─ 18. Compression      [Keep number]
├─ 19. Benchmarking     [Keep number]
└─ 20. Capstone         [Keep number]
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Zero breaking changes
- ✅ Students mid-course unaffected
- ✅ Git history stays clean
- ✅ No import changes needed
- ✅ Module 07 still valuable for advanced learners
- ✅ Documents architectural decision (the gap is intentional)
- ✅ Follows semantic versioning patterns (gaps are OK)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Number gap (07 skipped in core path)
- ⚠️ Requires clear documentation

---

## Option 3: Hybrid - Move 07 to Advanced (Compromise)

```
CORE PATH (01-06, 08-13)
├─ 01-06: Foundation
├─ 08-09: Vision
└─ 10-13: Language
    └─ All 5 Milestones

ADVANCED PATH (07, 14-20)
├─ 07. Training Abstractions    [Moved to advanced]
├─ 14. KV-Caching
├─ 15. Profiling
├─ 16. Acceleration
├─ 17. Quantization
├─ 18. Compression
├─ 19. Benchmarking
└─ 20. Capstone
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Preserves numbering
- ✅ Clear "core vs advanced" split
- ✅ Module 07 stays for advanced learners

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Still has the number gap
- ⚠️ Same as Option 2 really

---

## Recommended Decision: Option 2 (Keep Numbering)

### Why Keep the Numbering?

1. **Real-world precedent**: Version numbers often skip (Python 2.7 → 3.0, HTTP/1.1 → HTTP/2)

2. **Semantic meaning**: The gap documents a design decision
   - "We intentionally skip abstractions in the core path"
   - Future you will thank you for this documentation

3. **Zero breaking changes**: Students already in progress aren't affected

4. **Module 07 is still valuable**: Advanced students can learn PyTorch Lightning patterns

5. **Follows software versioning best practices**: Don't renumber for stability

### How to Document It

In main docs:
```markdown
## Core Learning Path (Required for Milestones)
- Modules 01-06: Foundation (Tensor → Optimizers)
- Module 07: [OPTIONAL - Advanced Training Patterns]
- Modules 08-09: Vision (DataLoader → Spatial)
- Modules 10-13: Language (Tokenization → Transformers)

## Advanced Learning Path (After All Milestones)
- Module 07: Training Abstractions (PyTorch Lightning patterns)
- Modules 14-20: Systems Optimization & Capstone
```

In Module 07 itself:
```markdown
# Module 07: Training Abstractions [OPTIONAL]

⚠️ **Skip this module in your first pass through TinyTorch!**

This module is **optional** and teaches advanced abstraction patterns like:
- PyTorch Lightning-style Trainer classes
- Learning rate scheduling
- Gradient clipping
- Checkpointing

**When to come back:**
- ✅ After completing all 5 milestones
- ✅ After writing manual training loops many times
- ✅ When you want to learn abstraction patterns

**Why we skip it initially:**
Manual training loops teach fundamentals better. Learn the basics first,
then learn when and why to abstract.
```

## Refactoring Impact Comparison

| Change Type | Option 1 (Renumber) | Option 2 (Keep) |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Module folders renamed | 13 folders | 0 folders |
| Import statements changed | ~100+ | 0 |
| Documentation updates | ~50+ files | 5 files |
| Test file changes | ~40+ | 0 |
| Breaking changes | YES | NO |
| Student impact | HIGH | NONE |
| Git history | Messy | Clean |
| Time to implement | 2-4 hours | 15 minutes |

---

## Final Recommendation

**Keep the current numbering (Option 2)** and:

1. ✅ Mark Module 07 as `[OPTIONAL - ADVANCED]` in all docs
2. ✅ Update milestone docs to show progression skips Module 07
3. ✅ Add clear "when to come back" guidance in Module 07
4. ✅ Keep Module 07 available for advanced learners
5. ✅ Zero breaking changes for students

The gap is a feature, not a bug - it documents an intentional design decision.

## Analogy: Like HTTP Versions

```
HTTP/0.9 (1991)  →  HTTP/1.0 (1996)  →  HTTP/1.1 (1997)  →  HTTP/2 (2015)
```

Notice the gap between 1.1 and 2? That gap has meaning - it represents a major paradigm shift.

Our gap between 06 → 08 has meaning too:
- "Core path: learn manual control first"
- "Abstractions come later, when you understand why"

This is good software design.
