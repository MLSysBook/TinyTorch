# Community Ecosystem

**Learn together, build together, grow together.**

TinyTorch is more than a course—it's a growing community of students, educators, and ML engineers learning systems engineering from first principles.

## Connect Now

### GitHub Discussions (Available Now ✅)

Join conversations with other TinyTorch builders:

**[Visit GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/harvard-edge/TinyTorch/discussions)**

- **Ask questions** about implementations and debugging
- **Share your projects** and milestone achievements
- **Help others** with systems thinking questions
- **Discuss ML systems** engineering and production practices

**Active discussion categories:**
- Module implementations and debugging
- Systems performance optimization
- Career advice for ML engineers
- Show and tell: Your TinyTorch projects

**Why community matters for TinyTorch:** Unlike watching lectures, building ML systems requires debugging, experimentation, and iteration. The community helps you debug faster, learn trade-offs, stay motivated, and build systems intuition through discussion.
