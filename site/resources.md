While TinyTorch teaches you to build complete ML systems from scratch, these resources provide broader context, alternative perspectives, and production tools.

**TinyTorch Learning Resources:**
- See [Student Workflow](student-workflow.md) for development workflow and progress tracking
- See [Testing Guide](testing-framework.md) for comprehensive testing methodology

## Alternative Implementations

**Different approaches to building ML systems from scratch - see how others tackle the same challenge:**

### Minimal Frameworks
- **[Micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd)** by Andrej Karpathy  
  *Minimal autograd engine in 100 lines. **Micrograd shows you the math, TinyTorch shows you the systems.***

- **[Microtorch](https://github.com/Kipre/microtorch)** by Kipre  
  *PyTorch-like API in pure Python. **Microtorch focuses on clean API design, TinyTorch emphasizes systems engineering and scalability.***

- **[Tinygrad](https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad)** by George Hotz  
  *Performance-focused educational framework. **Tinygrad optimizes for speed, TinyTorch optimizes for learning.***

- **[Neural Networks from Scratch](https://nnfs.io/)** by Harrison Kinsley  
  *Math-heavy implementation approach. **NNFS focuses on algorithms, TinyTorch focuses on systems engineering.***

## Production Internals

### Framework Deep Dives
- **[PyTorch Internals](http://blog.ezyang.com/2019/05/pytorch-internals/)** by Edward Yang  
  *How PyTorch actually works under the hood - a great read as see what you built in TinyTorch corresponds to the real PyTorch*

- **[PyTorch Documentation: Extending PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/extending.md)**  
  *Custom operators and autograd functions - apply your TinyTorch knowledge*

---

*Building ML systems from scratch gives you the implementation foundation most ML engineers lack. These resources help you apply that knowledge to broader systems and production environments.*
