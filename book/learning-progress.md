## Your Learning Path Overview

TinyTorch organizes learning through **three pedagogically-motivated tiers**, each building essential ML systems capabilities:

**üìñ See [Three-Tier Learning Structure](chapters/00-introduction.html#three-tier-learning-pathway-build-complete-ml-systems)** for detailed tier breakdown, time estimates, and learning outcomes.

## Student Learning Journey

### Typical Student Progression by Tier
- **üèóÔ∏è Foundation Tier (6-8 weeks)**: Build mathematical infrastructure - tensors, autograd, optimizers, training loops
- **üß† Intelligence Tier (4-6 weeks)**: Implement modern AI architectures - CNNs for vision, transformers for language
- **‚ö° Optimization Tier (4-6 weeks)**: Deploy production systems - profiling, quantization, acceleration

### Study Approaches
- **Complete Builder** (14-18 weeks): Implement all three tiers from scratch
- **Focused Explorer** (4-8 weeks): Pick specific tiers based on your goals
- **Guided Learner** (8-12 weeks): Study implementations with hands-on exercises

**üìñ See [Quick Start Guide](quickstart-guide.html)** for immediate hands-on experience with your first module.

## Track Your Progress

To monitor your capability development and learning progression, use the TITO checkpoint commands.

**üìñ See [Essential Commands](tito-essentials.html)** for complete command reference and usage examples.

**Approach**: You're building ML systems engineering capabilities through hands-on implementation. Each capability checkpoint validates practical competency, not just theoretical understanding.
