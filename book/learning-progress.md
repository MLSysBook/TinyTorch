## Your Learning Path Overview

TinyTorch organizes learning through four major phases, each building essential ML systems capabilities:

**ðŸ“– See [Complete Course Structure](chapters/00-introduction.html)** for the full learning timeline and detailed module descriptions.

## Student Learning Journey

### Typical Student Progression
- **Week 1-2**: Foundation capabilities (Environment, Tensors, Activations)
- **Week 3-4**: Core learning systems (Layers, Losses, Autograd)
- **Week 5-6**: Training and optimization (Optimizers, Training loops)
- **Week 7-8**: Advanced architectures (Spatial processing, Attention)
- **Week 9-12**: Production systems (Profiling, Optimization, Deployment)

### Study Approaches
- **Full Implementation** (8-12 weeks): Build every component from scratch
- **Guided Study** (4-6 weeks): Study solution notebooks with implementation exercises
- **Quick Exploration** (2 weeks): Focus on key concepts with provided implementations

**ðŸ“– See [Quick Start Guide](quickstart-guide.html)** for immediate hands-on experience with your first module.

## Track Your Progress

To monitor your capability development and learning progression, use the TITO checkpoint commands.

**ðŸ“– See [Essential Commands](tito-essentials.html)** for complete command reference and usage examples.

**Approach**: You're building ML systems engineering capabilities through hands-on implementation. Each capability checkpoint validates practical competency, not just theoretical understanding.
