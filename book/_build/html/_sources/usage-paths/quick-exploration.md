## Launch Immediately (0 Setup Required)

Click the **Launch Binder** button on any chapter to get:
- Live Jupyter environment in your browser
- Pre-configured TinyTorch development setup  
- Ability to run and modify all code immediately
- No installation, no account creation needed

```{admonition} What You'll Experience
:class: tip
**5 minutes from now**, you'll be implementing real ML components:
- **ReLU activation function** from scratch
- **Tensor operations** that power neural networks  
- **Dense layers** that transform data
- **Complete neural networks** for image classification
- **🔥 Language models** built from the same foundations

All running live in your browser!
```

## Recommended Exploration Path

### Start Here: Chapter 1 - Setup
- Understand the TinyTorch development workflow
- Get familiar with the educational approach
- See how components fit together

**[Launch Setup Chapter](../chapters/01-setup.md)**

### Then Try: Chapter 3 - Activations 
- Implement your first ML function (ReLU)
- See immediate visual results
- Understand why nonlinearity matters

**[Launch Activations Chapter](../chapters/03-activations.md)**

### Build Up: Chapter 4 - Layers
- Create the building blocks of neural networks
- Combine your ReLU with matrix operations
- See how simple math becomes powerful AI

**[Launch Layers Chapter](../chapters/04-layers.md)**

## Important Limitations

**Sessions are temporary:**
- Binder sessions timeout after ~20 minutes of inactivity
- Your work is **not saved** when the session ends
- Great for exploration, not for ongoing projects

**For persistent work:** Ready to build your own TinyTorch? → **[Serious Development Path](serious-development.md)**

## What You'll Understand

After exploring 2-3 chapters, you'll have hands-on understanding of:

- **How ML frameworks work under the hood**  
- **Why activation functions are crucial**  
- **How matrix multiplication powers neural networks**  
- **The relationship between layers, networks, and learning**  
- **Real implementation vs. high-level APIs**  
- **Why vision and language models share the same foundations**
