# üéØ Attention: The Transformer Revolution

**Self-attention mechanisms and the foundation of modern language models.**

```{admonition} üèóÔ∏è What You'll Build
:class: tip
**Self-attention from scratch**: Scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the core mechanisms that power transformers.
```

## üåü **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this module, you will:

- **Understand attention fundamentally**: Implement the scaled dot-product attention mechanism from the "Attention Is All You Need" paper
- **Build multi-head attention**: Create parallel attention heads and understand how they capture different aspects of sequences  
- **Master the math**: Query, Key, Value projections and how attention weights are computed
- **See the bigger picture**: How attention enables transformers to process sequences without recurrence

## üéØ **Core Concepts**

### **Self-Attention Mechanism**
```python
# The attention formula you'll implement
def attention(Q, K, V, mask=None):
    scores = Q @ K.T / sqrt(d_k)
    if mask: scores = mask_fill(scores, mask, -inf)
    weights = softmax(scores, dim=-1)
    return weights @ V
```

### **Multi-Head Attention**
- **Parallel processing**: Multiple attention heads capture different relationships
- **Learned projections**: Query, Key, Value transformations for each head
- **Concatenation**: Combining multiple perspectives into final output

### **Real Applications**
- **Language models**: GPT, BERT, and transformer architectures
- **Computer vision**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) for image classification
- **Sequence modeling**: Translation, summarization, and generation tasks

## üß± **Building Blocks**

This module connects to your previous work:
- **Tensors** (Module 2): Matrix operations for Q, K, V computations
- **Activations** (Module 3): Softmax for attention weight normalization  
- **Layers** (Module 4): Linear projections for query, key, value transformations
- **Dense Networks** (Module 5): Integration with feedforward components

## üöÄ **Looking Ahead**

Your attention implementation becomes crucial for:
- **Training Systems** (Module 8-11): Training transformer models on sequence data
- **Advanced Architectures**: Building complete transformer blocks
- **Production Systems** (Module 12-16): Optimizing attention for inference

```{admonition} üí° The Attention Revolution
:class: note
Attention didn't just improve neural networks‚Äîit revolutionized them. By allowing models to directly access any part of a sequence, attention enabled the transformer architecture that powers ChatGPT, BERT, and modern AI systems.

You're not just implementing a technique; you're building the foundation of modern AI.
```

## üìö **Module Structure**

- **Self-Attention Basics**: Scaled dot-product attention from scratch
- **Multi-Head Architecture**: Parallel attention computation  
- **Positional Understanding**: How transformers handle sequence order
- **Real Applications**: Using attention in classification and generation tasks
