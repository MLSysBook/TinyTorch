## 📊 Module Info
- **Difficulty**: ⭐⭐ Intermediate
- **Time Estimate**: 4-5 hours
- **Prerequisites**: Tensor, Activations modules
- **Next Steps**: Networks module

Build the fundamental transformations that compose into neural networks. This module teaches you that layers are simply functions that transform tensors, and neural networks are just sophisticated function composition using these building blocks.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- **Understand layers as mathematical functions**: Recognize that layers transform tensors through well-defined mathematical operations
- **Implement Dense layers**: Build linear transformations using matrix multiplication and bias addition (`y = Wx + b`)
- **Integrate activation functions**: Combine linear layers with nonlinear activations to enable complex pattern learning
- **Compose simple building blocks**: Chain layers together to create complete neural network architectures
- **Debug layer implementations**: Use shape analysis and mathematical properties to verify correct implementation

## 🧠 Build → Use → Reflect

This module follows TinyTorch's **Build → Use → Reflect** framework:

1. **Build**: Implement Dense layers and activation functions from mathematical foundations
2. **Use**: Transform tensors through layer operations and see immediate results in various scenarios
3. **Reflect**: Understand how simple layers compose into complex neural networks and why architecture matters

## 📚 What You'll Build

### Core Layer Implementation
```python
# Dense layer: fundamental building block
layer = Dense(input_size=3, output_size=2)
x = Tensor([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]])
y = layer(x)  # Shape transformation: (1, 3) → (1, 2)

# With activation functions
relu = ReLU()
activated = relu(y)  # Apply nonlinearity

# Chaining operations
layer1 = Dense(784, 128)  # Image → hidden
layer2 = Dense(128, 10)   # Hidden → classes
activation = ReLU()

# Forward pass composition
x = Tensor([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, ...]])  # Input data
h1 = activation(layer1(x))           # First transformation
output = layer2(h1)                  # Final prediction
```

### Dense Layer Implementation
- **Mathematical foundation**: Linear transformation `y = Wx + b`
- **Weight initialization**: Xavier/Glorot uniform initialization for stable gradients
- **Bias handling**: Optional bias terms for translation invariance
- **Shape management**: Automatic handling of batch dimensions and matrix operations

### Activation Layer Integration
- **ReLU integration**: Most common activation for hidden layers
- **Sigmoid integration**: Probability outputs for binary classification
- **Tanh integration**: Zero-centered outputs for better optimization
- **Composition patterns**: Standard ways to combine layers and activations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have completed the foundational modules:

```bash
# Activate TinyTorch environment
source bin/activate-tinytorch.sh

# Verify prerequisite modules
tito test --module tensor
tito test --module activations
```

### Development Workflow
1. **Open the development file**: `modules/source/04_layers/layers_dev.py`
2. **Implement Dense layer class**: Start with `__init__` and `forward` methods
3. **Test layer functionality**: Use inline tests for immediate feedback
4. **Add activation integration**: Combine layers with activation functions
5. **Build complete networks**: Chain multiple layers together
6. **Export and verify**: `tito export --module layers && tito test --module layers`

## 🧪 Testing Your Implementation

### Comprehensive Test Suite
Run the full test suite to verify mathematical correctness:

```bash
# TinyTorch CLI (recommended)
tito test --module layers

# Direct pytest execution
python -m pytest tests/ -k layers -v
```

### Test Coverage Areas
- ✅ **Layer Functionality**: Verify Dense layers perform correct linear transformations
- ✅ **Weight Initialization**: Ensure proper weight initialization for training stability
- ✅ **Shape Preservation**: Confirm layers handle batch dimensions correctly
- ✅ **Activation Integration**: Test seamless combination with activation functions
- ✅ **Network Composition**: Verify layers can be chained into complete networks

### Inline Testing & Development
The module includes educational feedback during development:
```python
# Example inline test output
🔬 Unit Test: Dense layer functionality...
✅ Dense layer computes y = Wx + b correctly
✅ Weight initialization within expected range
✅ Output shape matches expected dimensions
📈 Progress: Dense Layer ✓

# Integration testing
🔬 Unit Test: Layer composition...
✅ Multiple layers chain correctly
✅ Activations integrate seamlessly
📈 Progress: Layer Composition ✓
```

### Manual Testing Examples
```python
from tinytorch.core.tensor import Tensor
from layers_dev import Dense
from activations_dev import ReLU

# Test basic layer functionality
layer = Dense(input_size=3, output_size=2)
x = Tensor([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]])
y = layer(x)
print(f"Input shape: {x.shape}, Output shape: {y.shape}")

# Test layer composition
layer1 = Dense(3, 4)
layer2 = Dense(4, 2)
relu = ReLU()

# Forward pass
h1 = relu(layer1(x))
output = layer2(h1)
print(f"Final output: {output.data}")
```

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Real-World Applications
- **Computer Vision**: Dense layers process flattened image features in CNNs (like VGG, ResNet final layers)
- **Natural Language Processing**: Dense layers transform word embeddings in transformers and RNNs
- **Recommendation Systems**: Dense layers combine user and item features for preference prediction
- **Scientific Computing**: Dense layers approximate complex functions in physics simulations and engineering

### Mathematical Foundations
- **Linear Transformation**: `y = Wx + b` where W is the weight matrix and b is the bias vector
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Efficient batch processing through vectorized operations
- **Weight Initialization**: Xavier/Glorot initialization prevents vanishing/exploding gradients
- **Function Composition**: Networks as nested function calls: `f3(f2(f1(x)))`

### Neural Network Building Blocks
- **Modularity**: Layers as reusable components that can be combined in different ways
- **Standardized Interface**: All layers follow the same input/output pattern for easy composition
- **Shape Consistency**: Automatic handling of batch dimensions and shape transformations
- **Nonlinearity**: Activation functions between layers enable learning of complex patterns

### Implementation Patterns
- **Class-based Design**: Layers as objects with state (weights) and behavior (forward pass)
- **Initialization Strategy**: Proper weight initialization for stable training dynamics
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of shape mismatches and invalid inputs
- **Testing Philosophy**: Comprehensive testing of mathematical properties and edge cases
