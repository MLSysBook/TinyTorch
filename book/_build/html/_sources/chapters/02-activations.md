# Activations - Nonlinearity in Neural Networks

Welcome to the Activations module! This is where neural networks get their power through nonlinearity.

```{admonition} 🎯 Learning Goals
:class: tip
- Understand why activation functions are essential for neural networks
- Implement the four most important activation functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, and Softmax
- Visualize how activations transform data and enable complex learning
- See how activations work with layers to build powerful networks
- Master the NBGrader workflow with comprehensive testing
```


## Build → Use → Understand
1. **Build**: Activation functions that add nonlinearity
2. **Use**: Transform tensors and see immediate results
3. **Understand**: How nonlinearity enables complex pattern learning
