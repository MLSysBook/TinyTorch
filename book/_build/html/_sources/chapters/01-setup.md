# Setup - TinyTorch System Configuration

Welcome to TinyTorch! This setup module configures your personal TinyTorch installation and teaches you the NBGrader workflow.

```{admonition} üéØ Learning Goals
:class: tip
- Configure your personal TinyTorch installation with custom information
- Learn to query system information using Python modules
- Master the NBGrader workflow: implement ‚Üí test ‚Üí export
- Create functions that become part of your tinytorch package
- Understand solution blocks, hidden tests, and automated grading
```


## The Big Picture: Why Configuration Matters in ML Systems
Configuration is the foundation of any production ML system. In this module, you'll learn:

### 1. **System Awareness**
Real ML systems need to understand their environment:
- **Hardware constraints**: Memory, CPU cores, GPU availability
- **Software dependencies**: Python version, library compatibility
- **Platform differences**: Linux servers, macOS development, Windows deployment

### 2. **Reproducibility**
Configuration enables reproducible ML:
- **Environment documentation**: Exactly what system was used
- **Dependency management**: Precise versions and requirements
- **Debugging support**: System info helps troubleshoot issues

### 3. **Professional Development**
Proper configuration shows engineering maturity:
- **Attribution**: Your work is properly credited
- **Collaboration**: Others can understand and extend your setup
- **Maintenance**: Systems can be updated and maintained

### 4. **ML Systems Context**
This connects to broader ML engineering:
- **Model deployment**: Different environments need different configs
- **Monitoring**: System metrics help track performance
- **Scaling**: Understanding hardware helps optimize training

Let's build the foundation of your ML systems engineering skills!
