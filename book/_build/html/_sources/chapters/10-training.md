Build the complete training pipeline that brings all TinyTorch components together. This capstone module orchestrates data loading, model forward passes, loss computation, backpropagation, and optimization into the end-to-end training workflows that power modern AI systems.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- **Design complete training architectures**: Orchestrate all ML components into cohesive training systems
- **Implement essential loss functions**: Build MSE, CrossEntropy, and BinaryCrossEntropy from mathematical foundations
- **Create evaluation frameworks**: Develop metrics systems for classification, regression, and model performance assessment
- **Build production training loops**: Implement robust training workflows with validation, logging, and progress tracking
- **Master training dynamics**: Understand convergence, overfitting, generalization, and optimization in real scenarios

## üß† Build ‚Üí Use ‚Üí Optimize

This module follows TinyTorch's **Build ‚Üí Use ‚Üí Optimize** framework:

1. **Build**: Implement loss functions, evaluation metrics, and complete training orchestration systems
2. **Use**: Train end-to-end neural networks on real datasets with full pipeline automation
3. **Optimize**: Analyze training dynamics, debug convergence issues, and optimize training performance for production

## üìö What You'll Build

### Complete Training Pipeline
```python
# End-to-end training system
from tinytorch.core.training import Trainer
from tinytorch.core.losses import CrossEntropyLoss
from tinytorch.core.metrics import Accuracy

# Define complete model architecture
model = Sequential([
    Dense(784, 128), ReLU(),
    Dense(128, 64), ReLU(), 
    Dense(64, 10), Softmax()
])

# Configure training components
optimizer = Adam(model.parameters(), learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = CrossEntropyLoss()
metrics = [Accuracy()]

# Create and configure trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    optimizer=optimizer, 
    loss_fn=loss_fn,
    metrics=metrics
)

# Train with comprehensive monitoring
history = trainer.fit(
    train_dataloader=train_loader,
    val_dataloader=val_loader,
    epochs=50,
    verbose=True
)
```

### Loss Function Library
```python
# Regression loss for continuous targets
mse_loss = MeanSquaredError()
regression_loss = mse_loss(predictions, continuous_targets)

# Multi-class classification loss
ce_loss = CrossEntropyLoss()
classification_loss = ce_loss(logits, class_indices)

# Binary classification loss
bce_loss = BinaryCrossEntropyLoss()
binary_loss = bce_loss(sigmoid_outputs, binary_labels)

# All losses support batch processing and gradient computation
loss.backward()  # Automatic differentiation integration
```

### Evaluation Metrics System
```python
# Classification performance measurement
accuracy = Accuracy()
acc_score = accuracy(predictions, true_labels)  # Returns 0.0 to 1.0

# Regression error measurement  
mae = MeanAbsoluteError()
error = mae(predictions, targets)

# Extensible metric framework
class CustomMetric:
    def __call__(self, y_pred, y_true):
        # Implement custom evaluation logic
        return custom_score

metrics = [Accuracy(), CustomMetric()]
trainer = Trainer(model, optimizer, loss_fn, metrics)
```

### Real-World Training Workflows
```python
# Train on CIFAR-10 with full pipeline
from tinytorch.core.dataloader import CIFAR10Dataset, DataLoader

# Load and prepare data
train_dataset = CIFAR10Dataset("data/cifar10/", train=True, download=True)
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
val_loader = DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=False)

# Configure CNN for computer vision
cnn_model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(3, 16, kernel_size=3), ReLU(),
    MaxPool2D(kernel_size=2),
    Conv2D(16, 32, kernel_size=3), ReLU(),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(32 * 13 * 13, 128), ReLU(),
    Dense(128, 10)
])

# Train with monitoring and validation
trainer = Trainer(cnn_model, Adam(cnn_model.parameters()), CrossEntropyLoss(), [Accuracy()])
history = trainer.fit(train_loader, val_loader, epochs=100)

# Analyze training results
print(f"Final train accuracy: {history['train_accuracy'][-1]:.4f}")
print(f"Final val accuracy: {history['val_accuracy'][-1]:.4f}")
```
