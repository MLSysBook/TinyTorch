## üöÄ **The Capstone Challenge**

After completing the 14 core modules, you have a **complete ML framework**. Now optimize it, extend it, and make it faster through systems engineering:

### **‚ö° Track 1: Performance Engineering**
**Goal**: Make your TinyTorch framework faster and more memory-efficient

**Example Project**: *GPU-Accelerated Matrix Operations*
```python
# Current: CPU-only operations
def matmul_naive(A, B):
    return np.dot(A, B)  # Single-threaded, slow

# Your optimization: GPU kernels + vectorization
def matmul_optimized(A, B):
    # YOUR implementation using:
    # - NumPy vectorization
    # - Memory layout optimization  
    # - Cache-efficient algorithms
    # - Parallel computation
    pass
```

**Concrete Tasks:**
- Profile your current tensor operations and identify bottlenecks
- Implement vectorized operations that are 5-10x faster

- Benchmark against PyTorch and analyze performance gaps

---

### **üß† Track 2: Algorithm Extensions**
**Goal**: Add modern ML algorithms to your framework

**Example Project**: *Transformer Attention Block*

from tinytorch.core.layers import Dense

# Your extension: Modern attention mechanisms
class MultiHeadAttention:
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads):
        # YOUR implementation using only TinyTorch components
        self.query = Dense(d_model, d_model)
        self.key = Dense(d_model, d_model)  
        self.value = Dense(d_model, d_model)
        # ... attention math using your autograd

    def __init__(self):
        # Compare TinyTorch vs PyTorch on:
        # - Training speed and memory usage
        # - Accuracy on standard datasets
        # - Code complexity and maintainability
        pass
    
    def benchmark_operation(self, op_name, input_shapes):
        # Run identical operations in both frameworks
        tinytorch_time = self.benchmark_tinytorch(op_name, input_shapes)

## üèóÔ∏è **Getting Started: Example Walkthrough**

Let's walk through starting a **Performance Engineering** project:

### **Step 1: Profile Your Current Framework**
```python
import cProfile
import pstats
from memory_profiler import profile

# Profile your training loop
profiler = cProfile.Profile()
profiler.enable()

# Run your CIFAR-10 training from Module 10
model = create_mlp([3072, 128, 64, 10])
train_model(model, cifar10_data, epochs=1)

profiler.disable()
stats = pstats.Stats(profiler)
stats.sort_stats('cumulative')
stats.print_stats(20)  # Top 20 slowest functions
```

### **Step 2: Identify Bottlenecks**
```
Common findings:
- 60% of time in tensor operations (matmul, convolution)
- 25% of time in data loading and preprocessing  
- 10% of time in gradient computation
- 5% of time in optimizer updates
```

### **Step 3: Choose Your Target**
Focus on the biggest bottleneck. If it's tensor operations, implement:
```python
# Before: Naive implementation
def matmul_naive(A, B):
    # Your current implementation from Module 1
    pass

# After: Optimized implementation  
def matmul_vectorized(A, B):
    # Use advanced NumPy, better algorithms
    # Target: 5-10x speedup
    pass
```

### **Step 4: Implement and Test**
```python
# Benchmark your improvement
import time

A = np.random.randn(1000, 1000)
B = np.random.randn(1000, 1000)

# Test current implementation
start = time.time()
result1 = matmul_naive(A, B)
naive_time = time.time() - start

# Test optimized implementation
start = time.time()
result2 = matmul_vectorized(A, B)
optimized_time = time.time() - start

speedup = naive_time / optimized_time
print(f"Speedup: {speedup:.2f}x")
assert np.allclose(result1, result2)  # Verify correctness
```
