## 🧠 Build → Use → Analyze

This module follows TinyTorch's **Build → Use → Analyze** framework:

1. **Build**: Implement Variable class and gradient computation system using mathematical differentiation rules
2. **Use**: Apply automatic differentiation to complex expressions and neural network forward passes
3. **Analyze**: Understand computational graph construction, memory usage, and performance characteristics of autodiff systems

## 📚 What You'll Build

### Automatic Differentiation System
```python
# Variables track gradients automatically
x = Variable(5.0, requires_grad=True)
y = Variable(3.0, requires_grad=True)

# Complex mathematical expressions
z = x**2 + 2*x*y + y**3
print(f"f(x,y) = {z.data}")  # Forward pass result

# Automatic gradient computation
z.backward()
print(f"df/dx = {x.grad}")  # ∂f/∂x = 2x + 2y = 16
print(f"df/dy = {y.grad}")  # ∂f/∂y = 2x + 3y² = 37
```

### Neural Network Integration
```python
# Seamless integration with existing TinyTorch components
from tinytorch.core.layers import Dense
from tinytorch.core.activations import ReLU

# Create differentiable network
x = Variable([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]], requires_grad=True)
layer1 = Dense(3, 4)  # Weights automatically become Variables
layer2 = Dense(4, 1)
relu = ReLU()

# Forward pass builds computational graph
h1 = relu(layer1(x))
output = layer2(h1)
loss = output.sum()

# Backward pass computes all gradients
loss.backward()

# All parameters now have gradients
print(f"Layer 1 weight gradients: {layer1.weights.grad.shape}")
print(f"Layer 2 bias gradients: {layer2.bias.grad.shape}")
print(f"Input gradients: {x.grad.shape}")
```

### Computational Graph Construction
```python
# Automatic graph building for complex operations
def complex_function(x, y):
    a = x * y          # Multiplication node
    b = x + y          # Addition node  
    c = a / b          # Division node
    return c.sin()     # Trigonometric node

x = Variable(2.0, requires_grad=True)
y = Variable(3.0, requires_grad=True)
result = complex_function(x, y)

# Chain rule applied automatically through entire graph
result.backward()
print(f"Complex gradient dx: {x.grad}")
print(f"Complex gradient dy: {y.grad}")
```

z = (x + y) * (x - y)  # Difference of squares
z.backward()
print(f"d/dx = {x.grad}")  # Should be 2x = 4
print(f"d/dy = {y.grad}")  # Should be -2y = -6

# Test with transcendental functions
x = Variable(1.0, requires_grad=True)
y = x.exp().log()  # Should equal x
y.backward()
print(f"d(exp(log(x)))/dx: {x.grad}")  # Should be 1
