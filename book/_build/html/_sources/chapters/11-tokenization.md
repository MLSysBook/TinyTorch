# 11. Tokenization

```{admonition} Module Overview
:class: note
Text processing systems that convert raw text into numerical sequences for language models.
```

## What You'll Build

In this module, you'll implement the fundamental text processing systems that enable language models to understand human text:

- **Character-level tokenization** with special token handling for basic text processing
- **BPE (Byte Pair Encoding)** tokenizer for efficient subword unit representation
- **TokenizationProfiler** for analyzing performance characteristics and bottlenecks
- **OptimizedTokenizer** with cache-friendly text processing patterns

## Learning Objectives

```{admonition} ML Systems Focus
:class: tip
This module emphasizes text processing pipelines, tokenization throughput, and memory-efficient vocabulary management.
```

By completing this module, you will be able to:

1. **Implement character-level tokenization** with special token handling for basic text processing
2. **Build BPE (Byte Pair Encoding) tokenizer** for subword units that balance vocabulary size and sequence length
3. **Understand tokenization trade-offs** between vocabulary size and sequence length optimization
4. **Optimize tokenization performance** for production text processing systems
5. **Analyze how tokenization affects** model memory usage and training efficiency

## Systems Concepts

This module covers critical ML systems concepts:

- **Memory efficiency** of token representations and vocabulary storage
- **Vocabulary size vs model size** trade-offs in production language models
- **Tokenization throughput optimization** for high-volume text processing
- **String processing performance** and cache-friendly access patterns
- **Text processing pipeline design** for scalable language model serving

## Prerequisites

- **Module 02 (Tensor)**: Understanding of tensor operations and data structures

## Time Estimate

**4-5 hours** - Comprehensive implementation with performance optimization and systems analysis

## Getting Started

Open the tokenization module and begin implementing your text processing pipeline:

```python
# Navigate to the module
cd modules/11_tokenization

# Open the development notebook
tito module view 11_tokenization

# Complete the module
tito module complete 11_tokenization
```

## Next Steps

After completing tokenization, you'll be ready for:
- **Module 12 (Embeddings)**: Converting tokens to dense vector representations

## Production Context

Modern language models like GPT-3 use sophisticated tokenization strategies with vocabularies of 50,000+ tokens. Understanding how to build efficient tokenizers is essential for:

- **Preprocessing text** at scale for training large language models
- **Optimizing inference speed** by reducing sequence lengths through effective subword encoding
- **Managing memory usage** in production language model serving systems
- **Handling multilingual text** with robust encoding strategies

Your tokenization implementations form the foundation for all text-based ML systems in the TinyTorch framework.
