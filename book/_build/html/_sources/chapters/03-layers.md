# Layers - Building Blocks of Neural Networks

Welcome to the Layers module! This is where we build the fundamental components that stack together to form neural networks.

```{admonition} 🎯 Learning Goals
:class: tip
- Understand how matrix multiplication powers neural networks
- Implement naive matrix multiplication from scratch for deep understanding
- Build the Dense (Linear) layer - the foundation of all neural networks
- Learn weight initialization strategies and their importance
- See how layers compose with activations to create powerful networks
```


## Build → Use → Understand
1. **Build**: Matrix multiplication and Dense layers from scratch
2. **Use**: Create and test layers with real data
3. **Understand**: How linear transformations enable feature learning
