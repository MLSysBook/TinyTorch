# Training - Complete Neural Network Training Pipeline

Welcome to the Training module! This is where we bring everything together to train neural networks on real data.

```{admonition} 🎯 Learning Goals
:class: tip
- Understand loss functions and how they measure model performance
- Implement essential loss functions: MSE, CrossEntropy, and BinaryCrossEntropy
- Build evaluation metrics for classification and regression
- Create a complete training loop that orchestrates the entire process
- Master checkpointing and model persistence for real-world deployment
```


## Build → Use → Optimize
1. **Build**: Loss functions, metrics, and training orchestration
2. **Use**: Train complete models on real datasets
3. **Optimize**: Analyze training dynamics and improve performance
