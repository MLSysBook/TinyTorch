# Autograd - Automatic Differentiation Engine

Welcome to the Autograd module! This is where TinyTorch becomes truly powerful. You'll implement the automatic differentiation engine that makes neural network training possible.

```{admonition} 🎯 Learning Goals
:class: tip
- Understand how automatic differentiation works through computational graphs
- Implement the Variable class that tracks gradients and operations
- Build backward propagation for gradient computation
- Create the foundation for neural network training
- Master the mathematical concepts behind backpropagation
```


## Build → Use → Analyze
1. **Build**: Create the Variable class and gradient computation system
2. **Use**: Perform automatic differentiation on complex expressions
3. **Analyze**: Understand how gradients flow through computational graphs
