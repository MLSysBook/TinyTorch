# TinyTorch: Build Your Own ML Framework from First Principles

**Most ML education teaches you to _use_ frameworks. TinyTorch teaches you to _build_ them.**

TinyðŸ”¥Torch is a minimalist framework for building machine learning systems from scratchâ€”from tensors to systems. Instead of relying on PyTorch or TensorFlow, you implement everything yourselfâ€”tensors, autograd, optimizers, even MLOps tooling.

**The Vision: Train ML Systems Engineers, Not Just ML Users**

This hands-on approach builds the deep systems intuition that separates ML engineers from ML users. You'll understand not just *what* neural networks do, but *how* they work under the hood, *why* certain design choices matter in production, and *when* to make trade-offs between memory, speed, and accuracy.

```{admonition} What You'll Build: The Complete ML Evolution Story
:class: tip
**A complete ML framework from scratch** that recreates the history of ML breakthroughs:

**MLP Era (1980s): The Foundation**
- **Train MLPs to 95%+ accuracy on MNIST** (handwritten digit recognition)
- Implement automatic differentiation from first principles
- Master gradient-based optimization with SGD and Adam

**CNN Revolution (2012): Spatial Intelligence**
- **Modern CNNs**: Build convolutional networks from scratch
- **CIFAR-10 Achievement**: 75%+ accuracy on real images (our north star goal)
- **Spatial Operations**: Conv2d, MaxPool2d, and efficient data pipelines

**Transformer Era (2017-present): Language & Beyond**
- **TinyGPT**: Complete language models using your vision framework
- **Universal Architecture**: 95% component reuse from vision to language
- **Modern ML Systems**: Full pipeline from data loading to deployment

**Result:** You experience firsthand how ML evolved from simple perceptrons to modern AI systems, implementing every breakthrough yourself. All 20 modules pass comprehensive tests with 100% health status.
```

_Understanding how to build ML systems makes you a more effective ML engineer._

```{admonition} The Perfect Learning Combination
:class: note
TinyTorch was designed as the hands-on lab companion to [**Machine Learning Systems**](https://mlsysbook.ai) by [Prof. Vijay Janapa Reddi](https://vijay.seas.harvard.edu) (Harvard). The book teaches you ML systems **theory and principles** - TinyTorch lets you **implement and experience** those concepts firsthand. Together, they provide complete ML systems mastery.
```

## The Historic Journey: From MLPs to Modern AI

TinyTorch recreates the actual progression of machine learning breakthroughs. You don't just learn modern AI - you **experience the evolution that created it**:

```python
MLP Era (1980s):              CNN Revolution (2012):         Transformer Era (2017):
â”œâ”€â”€ class MLP:                â”œâ”€â”€ class CNN:                 â”œâ”€â”€ class TinyGPT:
â”‚   def forward(self, x):     â”‚   def forward(self, x):      â”‚   def forward(self, x):
â”‚   h = x.reshape(batch,-1)   â”‚   h = self.conv1(x)          â”‚   h = self.embed(x)
â”‚   h = self.fc1(h)           â”‚   h = self.pool(h)           â”‚   h = self.attention(h)
â”‚   return self.fc2(h)        â”‚   h = self.conv2(h)          â”‚   return self.lm_head(h)
â”‚                             â”‚   return self.fc(h.flat())   â”‚
â”‚ Result: 95%+ MNIST          â”‚ Result: 75%+ CIFAR-10        â”‚ Result: Language generation
â””â”€â”€ "Foundation for all       â””â”€â”€ "Spatial features excel"  â””â”€â”€ "Universal architecture"
    neural networks"

The SAME tensor operations power all three eras - you build them once, use everywhere.
```

**The ML Evolution Story:**
- **1980s**: MLPs could learn, but struggled with complex patterns
- **1989**: LeNet-1 proved convolutions extract spatial features  
- **1998**: LeNet-5 established CNNs as the vision standard
- **2012**: AlexNet showed deep CNNs dominate computer vision
- **2017**: Transformers unified vision AND language processing
- **Today**: Same mathematical foundations power all AI systems

TinyTorch focuses on implementation and systems thinking. You learn *how* to build working systems with progressive scaffolding, production ready practices, and comprehensive course infrastructure that bridges the gap between learning and building.

**What Makes This Different: Systems-First Thinking**

Traditional ML courses teach algorithms. TinyTorch teaches **ML systems engineering**:
- **Memory Management**: Why Adam uses 3Ã— more memory than SGD and when that matters
- **Performance Analysis**: How attention mechanisms scale O(NÂ²) and limit context length  
- **Production Trade-offs**: When to use gradient accumulation vs larger GPUs
- **Hardware Awareness**: How cache misses make naive convolution 100Ã— slower
- **System Design**: How autograd graphs consume memory and enable gradient checkpointing

**Result**: You become the engineer who designs ML systems, not just uses them.

## Learning Philosophy: Build, Use, Reflect

Every component follows the same powerful learning cycle:

### Example: Activation Functions

**Build:** Implement ReLU from scratch
```python
def relu(x):
    # YOU implement this function
    return np.maximum(0, x)  # Your solution
```

**Use:** Immediately use your own code
```python
from tinytorch.core.activations import ReLU  # YOUR implementation!
layer = ReLU()
output = layer.forward(input_tensor)  # Your code working!
```

**Reflect:** See it working in real networks
```python
# Your ReLU is now part of a real neural network
model = Sequential([
    Dense(784, 128),
    ReLU(),           # <-- Your implementation
    Dense(128, 10)
])
```

This pattern repeats for every component: tensors, layers, optimizers, even MLOps systems. You build it, use it immediately, then reflect on how it fits into larger systems.

### Track Your Capabilities

TinyTorch uses a [checkpoint system](checkpoint-system.md) to track your progress through **ML systems engineering capabilities**:
- **Foundation** â†’ Core ML primitives and setup
- **Architecture** â†’ Neural network building  
- **Training** â†’ Model training pipeline
- **Inference** â†’ Deployment and optimization
- **Serving** â†’ Complete system integration

Use `tito checkpoint status` to see your progress anytime!

### Beyond Code: Systems Intuition

Each module includes **ML Systems Thinking** sections that connect your implementations to production reality:
- *"How does your tensor implementation compare to PyTorch's memory management?"*
- *"When would you choose SGD over Adam in production training?"* 
- *"How do frameworks handle the quadratic memory scaling of attention?"*
- *"What happens to your autograd implementation under distributed training?"*

These aren't just academic questions - they're the system-level challenges that ML engineers solve every day.
