## Track Your Progress

To monitor your capability development and learning progression, use the TITO checkpoint commands.

**📖 See [Essential Commands](tito-essentials.html)** for complete command reference and usage examples.

**Approach**: You're building ML systems engineering capabilities through hands-on implementation. Each capability checkpoint validates practical competency, not just theoretical understanding.
