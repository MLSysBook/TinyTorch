# üèÜ TinyTorch Competitions

## Educational Challenges, Not Just Leaderboards

TinyTorch competitions are **planned educational challenges** designed to deepen your understanding of ML systems through hands-on problem solving. These aren't just about who gets the highest scores‚Äîthey're about learning systems engineering principles while building real ML systems.

### The Educational Vision

We're designing competitions that teach you to think like an ML systems engineer:

- **Efficiency Mastery**: Achieve accuracy targets within strict memory/compute constraints
- **Systems Understanding**: Debug and optimize real bottlenecks in your implementations
- **Innovation Challenges**: Solve problems using creative system design approaches
- **Collaborative Learning**: Learn from others' approaches while building your own solutions

### Planned Competition Categories

**üéØ Accuracy Challenges**
- **CIFAR-10 Sprint**: First to achieve 75% accuracy using only your TinyTorch implementations
- **Efficient Training**: Highest accuracy achieved within memory limits (256MB, 512MB, 1GB tiers)
- **Small Model Olympics**: Best performance with parameter count restrictions

**‚ö° Performance Challenges**
- **Speed Runs**: Fastest training time to reach accuracy milestones
- **Memory Optimization**: Lowest memory usage while maintaining target accuracy
- **Inference Efficiency**: Fastest model inference on standard hardware

**üõ†Ô∏è Systems Mastery Challenges**
- **Debugging Olympics**: Identify and fix intentionally buggy implementations
- **Scaling Challenges**: Optimize code for larger datasets and models
- **Hardware Awareness**: Best use of CPU vectorization and cache efficiency

**üí° Innovation Competitions**
- **Creative Implementations**: Most elegant solution to standard ML problems
- **Novel Optimizations**: Discover new ways to improve training efficiency
- **Educational Tools**: Build the best learning aids for future TinyTorch students

### How Competitions Will Work

**Learning-First Design:**
```bash
# Future CLI commands (in development)
tito compete list                    # See available challenges
tito compete join accuracy-sprint    # Register for a challenge
tito compete submit --challenge=cifar10  # Submit your solution
tito compete results --detailed      # See results with learning insights
```

**What Makes These Different:**
- **Detailed Analysis**: Every submission gets performance profiling and optimization suggestions
- **Learning Resources**: Access to hints, debugging guides, and optimization tutorials
- **Peer Review**: Option to share your approach and learn from others' solutions
- **Multiple Tiers**: Challenges for beginners (20% accuracy) through experts (90%+)

### Competition Timeline

**Phase 1: Foundation Building** (Next 2-3 months)
- Community feedback and competition design
