## What This Will Be

The TinyTorch Community Leaderboard is a **planned feature** to help learners track their progress and connect with others building ML systems from scratch.

### The Vision

We want to create an inclusive space where:
- Everyone can track their learning journey (from 10% to 90% accuracy)
- Students can find study partners at similar skill levels
- Progress is celebrated at all stages, not just the top scores
- The community helps each other debug and improve

### How It Will Work

**Simple Progress Tracking:**
```bash
# Future CLI commands (not yet implemented)
tito leaderboard join        # Register for the community
tito leaderboard submit      # Submit your model's accuracy
tito leaderboard view        # See community progress
```

**What We'll Track:**
- Your best accuracy on standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10, etc.)
- Which modules you've completed
- Your learning streak (days active)
- Helpful contributions to others

### Community Levels

We envision organizing learners into supportive groups:

- **🚀 Starting** (<20% accuracy) - Just beginning the journey
- **🌱 Learning** (20-40%) - Building foundations
- **📈 Progressing** (40-60%) - Gaining momentum
- **⭐ Advanced** (60-80%) - Mastering concepts
- **🏆 Elite** (80%+) - Systems experts

### Special Events

**Monthly Olympics** (planned):
- Efficiency challenges (highest accuracy with memory limits)
- Speed runs (fastest to reach milestones)
- Creative implementations (most innovative approaches)

### Join the Discussion

Want to help shape this feature? We'd love your input:

- What would motivate you to participate?
- What metrics matter most to you?
- How can we make this inclusive for all skill levels?

## Current Status

🚧 **Under Development** 

The leaderboard system is planned but not yet implemented. For now:

1. **Track your own progress** using the checkpoint system:
   ```bash
   tito checkpoint status
   ```

2. **Share your achievements** in our community:
   - Post your progress in GitHub Discussions
   - Share your accuracy milestones
   - Ask for help when stuck

3. **Connect with others**:
   - Find study partners in Discussions
   - Share debugging tips
   - Celebrate breakthroughs together
