```{div} badges
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚è±Ô∏è 4-6 hours
```


**The Culmination: From 1980s MLPs ‚Üí 1989 CNNs ‚Üí 2017 Transformers Using ONE Framework**

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

1. **Complete the ML evolution story** by building GPT-style transformers with components you created for computer vision
2. **Prove framework universality** using 95% component reuse from MLPs (52.7%) and CNNs (LeNet-5: 47.5%)
3. **Understand the 2017 transformer breakthrough** that unified vision and language processing
4. **Implement autoregressive language generation** using the same Dense layers that powered your CNNs
5. **Experience framework generalization** - how one set of mathematical primitives enables any AI task
6. **Master the complete ML timeline** from 1980s foundations to modern language models

## What Makes This Revolutionary

This module proves that **modern AI is built on universal foundations**:

- **95% component reuse**: Your MLP tensors, CNN layers, and training systems work unchanged for language
- **Historical continuity**: The same math that achieved 52.7% on CIFAR-10 now powers GPT-style generation
- **Framework universality**: Vision and language are just different arrangements of identical operations
- **Career significance**: You understand how AI systems generalize across any domain

## Components Implemented

### Core Language Processing
- **CharTokenizer**: Character-level tokenization with vocabulary management
- **PositionalEncoding**: Sinusoidal position embeddings for sequence order

### Attention Mechanisms  
- **MultiHeadAttention**: Parallel attention heads for capturing different relationships
- **SelfAttention**: Simplified attention for easier understanding
- **CausalMasking**: Preventing attention to future tokens in autoregressive models

### Transformer Architecture
- **LayerNorm**: Normalization for stable transformer training
- **TransformerBlock**: Complete transformer layer with attention + feedforward
- **TinyGPT**: Full GPT-style model with embedding, positional encoding, and generation

### Training Infrastructure
- **LanguageModelLoss**: Cross-entropy loss with proper target shifting
- **LanguageModelTrainer**: Training loops optimized for text sequences
- **TextGeneration**: Autoregressive sampling for coherent text generation

## Key Insights: The Universal ML Framework

1. **Historical Vindication**: The 1980s mathematical foundations you built for MLPs now power 2017 transformers
2. **Framework Universality**: Vision (CNNs) and language (GPTs) use identical mathematical primitives
3. **Architecture Evolution**: MLPs ‚Üí CNNs ‚Üí Transformers are just different arrangements of the same operations
4. **Component Reuse**: Your 52.7% CIFAR-10 training systems work unchanged for language generation

## The Complete ML Evolution Story

This module completes your journey through ML history:

**üß† 1980s MLP Era**: You built the mathematical foundation
