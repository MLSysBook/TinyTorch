# 19. KV Caching

## Optimizing Transformer Inference with Key-Value Caching

KV (Key-Value) caching is a critical optimization technique for transformer models that dramatically speeds up autoregressive generation. In this module, you'll learn how to implement KV caching to avoid redundant attention computations during inference.

### What You'll Build

- **KV Cache**: Key-Value caching for attention mechanisms
- **Feature Cache**: Reuse computed features across requests
- **Gradient Cache**: Efficient gradient accumulation
- **Model Cache**: Multi-level model weight caching

### Why This Matters

Caching is essential for production ML systems:
- Transformer models recompute attention for every token
- Feature extraction is often the bottleneck
- Redundant computations waste resources
- Smart caching can provide 10-100x speedups

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Implement KV caching for transformer attention layers
- Understand how KV caching reduces O(nÂ²) to O(n) complexity
- Build efficient cache management for multi-turn generation
- Measure the memory-speed tradeoff in production systems

### Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have completed:
- Module 13: Attention (for KV cache understanding)
- Module 14: Transformers (for practical application)
- Module 15: Profiling (to measure improvements)

### Real-World Applications

Caching is critical in production ML:
- **ChatGPT**: KV caching for multi-turn conversations
- **Search Engines**: Feature caching for ranking
- **Recommendation Systems**: User embedding caches
- **Computer Vision**: Intermediate feature caching

### Coming Up Next

After mastering caching, you'll explore:
- Module 20: Benchmarking - Measuring the full impact of optimizations
- Capstone Project: Building TinyGPT with all optimizations
