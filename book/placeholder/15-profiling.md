# ðŸ“Š Module 15: Profiling

```{admonition} Coming Soon!
:class: warning
This module is currently under development. We're building professional profiling infrastructure including:

- **Statistical timing** with confidence intervals
- **Memory allocation tracking** and leak detection
- **FLOP counting** for computational analysis
- **Bottleneck identification** methodology
```

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Build

When complete, this module will teach you to:

### Core Profiling Systems
- **Timer**: Statistical timing with warmup and confidence intervals
- **MemoryProfiler**: Allocation tracking and memory analysis
- **FLOPCounter**: Computational complexity measurement
- **SimpleProfiler**: Unified profiling interface

### ML Systems Concepts
- **Performance measurement** methodology
- **Statistical rigor** in benchmarking
- **Memory allocation** patterns and optimization
- **Profiling overhead** minimization

## ðŸ“‹ Module Status

**Estimated Development**: Spring 2025  
**Dependencies**: Module 14 (Transformers)  
**Estimated Time**: 8-10 hours

## ðŸš€ Coming Next

This module becomes the foundation for **Modules 16-20**, where you'll use professional profiling to guide optimization decisions across acceleration, quantization, compression, caching, and benchmarking.
