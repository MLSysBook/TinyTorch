# üóÑÔ∏è Module 19: Caching

```{admonition} Coming Soon!
:class: warning
This module is currently under development. We're building intelligent caching systems including:

- **KV caching** for transformer inference optimization
- **Activation caching** for training acceleration
- **Model weight caching** for multi-model serving
- **Cache eviction policies** for memory management
```

## üéØ What You'll Build

When complete, this module will teach you to:

### Core Caching Systems
- **KVCache**: Key-value caching for attention mechanisms
- **ActivationCache**: Intermediate result caching for training
- **ModelCache**: Efficient model weight management
- **CacheManager**: Intelligent eviction and prefetching

### ML Systems Concepts
- **Cache hit rates** and performance impact
- **Memory hierarchy** optimization
- **Cache coherence** in distributed systems
- **Prefetching strategies** for predictable access patterns

## üìã Module Status

**Estimated Development**: Spring 2025  
**Dependencies**: Module 15 (Profiling), Module 18 (Compression)  
**Estimated Time**: 5-6 hours

## üöÄ Coming Next

This module culminates in **Module 20: Benchmarking**, where you'll measure the combined impact of all your optimizations.
