# ‚öóÔ∏è Module 17: Quantization

```{admonition} Coming Soon!
:class: warning
This module is currently under development. We're building comprehensive quantization systems including:

- **Post-training quantization** for immediate deployment
- **Quantization-aware training** for accuracy preservation
- **Dynamic quantization** for runtime optimization
- **INT8/INT4 kernels** for maximum performance
```

## üéØ What You'll Build

When complete, this module will teach you to:

### Core Quantization Systems
- **QuantizedTensor**: Efficient low-precision representations
- **QuantizationCalibrator**: Optimal scaling factor computation
- **QAT (Quantization-Aware Training)**: Training with quantization simulation
- **QuantizedOperations**: Optimized INT8/INT4 operations

### ML Systems Concepts
- **Quantization error** analysis and mitigation
- **Memory bandwidth** optimization through reduced precision
- **Hardware acceleration** with integer operations
- **Accuracy-performance tradeoffs** in production systems

## üìã Module Status

**Estimated Development**: Spring 2025  
**Dependencies**: Module 15 (Profiling), Module 16 (Acceleration)  
**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours

## üöÄ Coming Next

This module connects with **Module 18: Compression** and **Module 19: Caching** to build complete model optimization pipelines.
