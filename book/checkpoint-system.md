## 🛠️ Using the Checkpoint System

### CLI Commands

#### Check Your Progress
```bash
tito checkpoint status           # Current progress overview with capability statements
tito checkpoint status --detailed # Module-level detail with test file status
```

#### Rich Visual Timeline
```bash
tito checkpoint timeline         # Vertical tree view with connecting lines
tito checkpoint timeline --horizontal # Linear progress bar with Rich styling
```

#### Test Capabilities
```bash
tito checkpoint test 01          # Test specific checkpoint (01-15)
tito checkpoint test             # Test current checkpoint
tito checkpoint run 00 --verbose # Run checkpoint with detailed output
tito checkpoint unlock          # Show next checkpoint to unlock
```

#### Module Completion Workflow 
```bash
tito module complete 02_tensor   # Complete module with export and checkpoint testing
tito module complete tensor      # Works with short names too
tito module complete 02_tensor --skip-test # Skip checkpoint test if needed
```

**What `tito module complete` does:**
1. **Exports module** to the `tinytorch` package
2. **Maps to checkpoint** (e.g., 02_tensor → checkpoint_01_foundation)
3. **Runs capability test** with Rich progress tracking
4. **Shows achievement** celebration and next steps

### Integration with Development
The checkpoint system connects directly to your actual development work:

#### Automatic Module-to-Checkpoint Mapping
```bash
# Each module maps to a specific checkpoint:
01_setup      → checkpoint_00_environment   # Environment setup
02_tensor     → checkpoint_01_foundation    # Tensor operations
03_activations → checkpoint_02_intelligence # Activation functions
04_layers     → checkpoint_03_components    # Neural building blocks
05_dense      → checkpoint_04_networks      # Multi-layer networks
06_spatial    → checkpoint_05_learning      # Spatial processing
07_attention  → checkpoint_06_attention     # Attention mechanisms
08_dataloader → checkpoint_07_stability     # Data preparation
09_autograd   → checkpoint_08_differentiation # Gradient computation
10_optimizers → checkpoint_09_optimization  # Optimization algorithms
11_training   → checkpoint_10_training      # Training loops
12_compression → checkpoint_11_regularization # Model compression
13_kernels    → checkpoint_12_kernels       # High-performance ops
14_benchmarking → checkpoint_13_benchmarking # Performance analysis
15_mlops      → checkpoint_14_deployment    # Production deployment
16_tinygpt    → checkpoint_15_capstone      # Language model extension
```

#### Real Capability Validation
- **Not just code completion**: Tests verify actual functionality works
- **Import testing**: Ensures modules export correctly to package
- **Functionality testing**: Validates capabilities like tensor operations, neural layers
- **Integration testing**: Confirms components work together

#### Rich Visual Feedback

## 🏗️ Implementation Architecture

### 16 Individual Test Files
Each checkpoint is implemented as a standalone Python test file in `tests/checkpoints/`:
```
tests/checkpoints/
├── checkpoint_00_environment.py   # "Can I configure my environment?"
├── checkpoint_01_foundation.py    # "Can I create ML building blocks?"
├── checkpoint_02_intelligence.py  # "Can I add nonlinearity?"
├── ...
└── checkpoint_15_capstone.py      # "Can I build complete end-to-end ML systems?"
```

## 🧠 Why This Approach Works

### Systems Thinking Over Task Completion
Traditional approach: *"I finished Module 3"*  
Checkpoint approach: *"My framework can now build neural networks"

### Clear Learning Goals
Every module contributes to a **concrete system capability** rather than abstract completion.

### Academic Progress Markers
- **Rich CLI visualizations** with progress bars and connecting lines show your growing ML framework
- **Capability unlocks** feel like real learning milestones achieved in academic progression
- **Clear direction** toward complete ML systems mastery through structured checkpoints
- **Visual timeline** similar to academic transcripts tracking completed coursework

### Real-World Relevance
The checkpoint progression **Foundation → Architecture → Training → Inference → Language Models** mirrors both academic learning progression and the evolution from specialized to unified ML frameworks.
