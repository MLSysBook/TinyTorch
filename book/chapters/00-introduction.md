# Course Introduction: ML Systems Engineering Through Implementation

**Transform from ML user to ML systems engineer by building everything yourself.**

## The Origin Story: Why TinyTorch Exists

### The Problem We're Solving

There's a critical gap in ML engineering today. Plenty of people can use ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, etc.), but very few understand the systems underneath. This creates real problems:

- **Engineers deploy models** but can't debug when things go wrong
- **Teams hit performance walls** because no one understands the bottlenecks
- **Companies struggle to scale** - whether to tiny edge devices or massive clusters
- **Innovation stalls** when everyone is limited to existing framework capabilities

### How TinyTorch Began

TinyTorch started as exercises for the [MLSysBook.ai](https://mlsysbook.ai) textbook - students needed hands-on implementation experience. But it quickly became clear this addressed a much bigger problem:

**The industry desperately needs engineers who can BUILD ML systems, not just USE them.**

Deploying ML systems at scale is hard. Scale means both directions:
- **Small scale**: Running models on edge devices with 1MB of RAM
- **Large scale**: Training models across thousands of GPUs
- **Production scale**: Serving millions of requests with <100ms latency

We need more engineers who understand memory hierarchies, computational graphs, kernel optimization, distributed communication - the actual systems that make ML work.

### Our Solution: Learn By Building

TinyTorch teaches ML systems the only way that really works: **by building them yourself**.

When you implement your own tensor operations, write your own autograd, build your own optimizer - you gain understanding that's impossible to achieve by just calling APIs. You learn not just what these systems do, but HOW they do it and WHY they're designed that way.

## What Makes TinyTorch Different

Most ML education teaches you to **use** frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, etc.). TinyTorch teaches you to **build** them.

This fundamental difference creates engineers who understand systems deeply, not just APIs superficially.

### The Learning Philosophy: Build → Use → Reflect

**Traditional Approach:**
```python
import torch
model = torch.nn.Linear(784, 10)  # Use someone else's implementation
output = model(input)             # Trust it works, don't understand how
```

**TinyTorch Approach:**
```python
# 1. BUILD: You implement Linear from scratch
class Linear:
    def forward(self, x):
        return x @ self.weight + self.bias  # You write this
        
# 2. USE: Your implementation in action
from tinytorch.core.layers import Linear  # YOUR code
model = Linear(784, 10)                  # YOUR implementation
output = model(input)                    # YOU know exactly how this works

# 3. REFLECT: Systems thinking
# "Why does matrix multiplication dominate compute time?"
# "How does this scale with larger models?"
# "What memory optimizations are possible?"
```

## What You'll Achieve: Complete ML Systems Mastery

### Immediate Achievements (Modules 1-8)
By Module 8, you'll have built a complete neural network framework from scratch:

```python
# YOUR implementation training real networks on real data
model = Sequential([
    Linear(784, 128),    # Your linear layer
    ReLU(),              # Your activation function  
    Linear(128, 64),     # Your architecture design
    ReLU(),              # Your nonlinearity
    Linear(64, 10)       # Your final classifier
])

# YOUR training loop using YOUR optimizer
optimizer = Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)  # Your Adam implementation
for batch in dataloader:  # Your data loading
    output = model(batch.x)                     # Your forward pass
    loss = CrossEntropyLoss()(output, batch.y)  # Your loss function
    loss.backward()                             # Your backpropagation
    optimizer.step()                            # Your parameter updates

## Systems Engineering Focus: Why It Matters

Traditional ML courses focus on **algorithms**. TinyTorch focuses on **systems**.

### What Traditional Courses Teach:
- "Use `torch.optim.Adam` for optimization"
- "Transformers use attention mechanisms"  
- "Larger models generally perform better"

### What TinyTorch Teaches:
- "Why Adam consumes 3× more memory than SGD and when that matters in production"
- "How attention scales O(N²) with sequence length and limits context windows"
- "How to profile memory usage and identify training bottlenecks"

### Career Impact
After TinyTorch, you become the team member who:
- **Debugs performance issues**: "Your convolution is memory-bound, not compute-bound"
- **Optimizes production systems**: "We can use gradient accumulation to train with less GPU memory"
- **Implements custom operations**: "I'll write a custom kernel for this novel architecture"
- **Designs system architecture**: "Here's why this model won't scale and how to fix it"
