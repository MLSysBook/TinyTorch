# 17. Quantization

## Reducing Model Size Without Losing Accuracy

Quantization is a critical technique for deploying ML models in production, especially on edge devices. In this module, you'll learn how to reduce model size and increase inference speed by converting floating-point weights to lower precision formats.

### What You'll Build

- **INT8 Quantization**: Convert 32-bit floats to 8-bit integers
- **Quantization-Aware Training**: Train models that quantize well
- **Dynamic Quantization**: Quantize activations at runtime
- **Static Quantization**: Pre-compute quantization parameters

### Why This Matters

Modern ML models are often too large for deployment:
- GPT models can be hundreds of gigabytes
- Mobile devices have limited memory
- Edge computing requires efficient models
- Quantization can reduce model size by 75% with minimal accuracy loss

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand the trade-offs between model size and accuracy
- Implement INT8 quantization from scratch
- Build quantization-aware training pipelines
- Measure the impact on model performance

### Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have completed:
- Module 02: Tensor (for basic operations)
- Module 04: Layers (for model structure)
- Module 08: Training (for fine-tuning quantized models)

### Real-World Applications

Quantization is used everywhere in production ML:
- **Mobile Apps**: TensorFlow Lite uses INT8 for on-device inference
- **Edge Devices**: Raspberry Pi and Arduino deployment
- **Cloud Inference**: Reducing serving costs at scale
- **Neural Processors**: Apple Neural Engine, Google Edge TPU

### Coming Up Next

After mastering quantization, you'll explore:
- Module 18: Compression - Further model size reduction techniques
- Module 19: Caching - Optimizing inference latency
- Module 20: Benchmarking - Measuring the impact of optimizations
