## üí° Pro Tips for Capstone Success

### üéØ Start With Impact
```python
# Instead of optimizing everything...
def optimize_everything():
    pass  # This leads to shallow improvements
    
# Find the biggest bottleneck first
def profile_and_optimize():
    bottleneck = find_biggest_bottleneck()  # 80% of runtime
    return optimize_specific_operation(bottleneck)  # 10x speedup
```

### üß™ Measure Everything
- **Baseline early**: Know your starting point precisely
- **Benchmark often**: Track progress with each change
- **Compare fairly**: Use identical test conditions
- **Document trade-offs**: Speed vs memory vs complexity

### üîó Use Your Existing Framework
```python
# Test improvements with models you built in previous modules
cifar_model = load_your_module_10_model()  # Real CNN from Module 6
test_your_optimization(cifar_model)        # Does it still work?
measure_improvement(cifar_model)           # How much faster/better?
```

### üìö Think Like a Framework Maintainer
- **API design**: How would other students use your improvements?
- **Documentation**: Can someone else understand and extend your work?
- **Testing**: What could break? How do you prevent it?
- **Compatibility**: Does existing code still work?
