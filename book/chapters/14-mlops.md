# MLOps - Production ML Systems

Welcome to the MLOps module! This is where we close the loop on the complete ML system lifecycle.

```{admonition} 🎯 Learning Goals
:class: tip
- Understand why ML models degrade over time without maintenance
- Implement performance monitoring and drift detection systems
- Build automated retraining triggers that use your training pipeline
- Create model comparison and deployment workflows
- See how all TinyTorch components work together in production
```


## Build → Use → Deploy
1. **Build**: Complete MLOps infrastructure for model lifecycle management
2. **Use**: Deploy and monitor ML systems that automatically respond to issues
3. **Deploy**: Create production-ready systems that maintain themselves over time
