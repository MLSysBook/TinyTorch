# 20. AI Olympics

**Your Capstone Project**

---

## 🎯 Overview

The AI Olympics is your final capstone project where you bring together everything you've learned throughout the course. You'll optimize your TinyTorch implementation and see how it performs.

### What You'll Do

- **Apply your knowledge**: Use all the modules you've built (tensors through optimizations)
- **Optimize your system**: Experiment with different performance improvements
- **Benchmark your work**: Measure speed, memory, and efficiency
- **Take part in competition**: Compare your results with others (optional)

This is about learning to care about **performance, not just correctness**—which is what production ML engineering is all about.
