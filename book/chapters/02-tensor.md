## üìä Module Info
- **Difficulty**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê Intermediate
- **Time Estimate**: 4-6 hours
- **Prerequisites**: Setup module
- **Next Steps**: Activations, Layers

Build the foundation of TinyTorch! This module implements the core Tensor class - the fundamental data structure that powers all neural networks and machine learning operations.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- **Understand what tensors are** and why they're essential for ML
- **Implement a complete Tensor class** with core operations
- **Handle tensor shapes, data types, and memory management** efficiently
- **Implement element-wise operations and reductions** with proper broadcasting
- **Have a solid foundation** for building neural networks

## üß† Build ‚Üí Use ‚Üí Understand

1. **Build**: Complete Tensor class with arithmetic operations, shape management, and reductions
2. **Use**: Create tensors, perform operations, and validate with real data
3. **Understand**: How tensors serve as the foundation for all neural network computations

## üìö What You'll Build

### Core Tensor Class
```python
# Creating tensors
x = Tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
y = Tensor([[0.5, 1.5], [2.5, 3.5]])

# Properties
print(x.shape)    # (2, 2)
print(x.size)     # 4
print(x.dtype)    # float64

# Element-wise operations
z = x + y         # Addition
w = x * y         # Multiplication
p = x ** 2        # Exponentiation

# Shape manipulation
reshaped = x.reshape(4, 1)  # (4, 1)
transposed = x.T            # (2, 2) transposed

# Reductions
total = x.sum()             # Scalar sum
means = x.mean(axis=0)      # Mean along axis
```

### Essential Operations
- **Arithmetic**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers
- **Shape management**: Reshape, transpose, broadcasting rules
- **Reductions**: Sum, mean, min, max along any axis
- **Memory handling**: Efficient data storage and copying

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites Check
```bash
tito test --module setup  # Should pass ‚úÖ
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Navigate to tensor module
cd modules/source/02_tensor

# Open development file
jupyter notebook tensor_dev.ipynb
# OR edit directly: code tensor_dev.py
```

### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Basic Tensor class** - Constructor and properties
2. **Shape management** - Understanding tensor dimensions
3. **Arithmetic operations** - Addition, multiplication, etc.
4. **Utility methods** - Reshape, transpose, sum, mean
5. **Error handling** - Robust edge case management

## üß™ Testing Your Implementation

### Inline Testing
```python
# Test in the notebook or Python REPL
x = Tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
print(f"Shape: {x.shape}")  # Should be (2, 2)
print(f"Sum: {x.sum()}")    # Should be 10.0
```

### Module Tests
```bash
# Export your tensor implementation
tito export

# Test your implementation
tito test --module tensor
```

### Manual Verification
```python
# Create and test tensors
from tinytorch.core.tensor import Tensor

x = Tensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = Tensor([2, 4, 6, 8, 10])

# Test operations
assert (x + y).data.tolist() == [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
assert (x * 2).data.tolist() == [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
print("‚úÖ Basic operations working!")
```

## üéØ Key Concepts

### **Tensors as Universal Data Structures**
- **Scalars**: 0-dimensional tensors (single numbers)
- **Vectors**: 1-dimensional tensors (arrays) 
- **Matrices**: 2-dimensional tensors (common in ML)
- **Higher dimensions**: Images (3D), video (4D), etc.

### **Why Tensors Matter in ML**
- **Neural networks**: All computations operate on tensors
- **GPU acceleration**: operates on tensor primitives
- **Broadcasting**: Efficient operations across different shapes
- **Vectorization**: Process entire datasets simultaneously

### **Real-World Connections**
- **PyTorch/TensorFlow**: Your implementation mirrors production frameworks
- **NumPy**: Foundation for scientific computing (we build similar abstractions)
- **Production systems**: Understanding tensors is essential for ML engineering

### **Memory and Performance**
- **Data layout**: How tensors store data efficiently
- **Broadcasting**: Smart operations without data copying
- **View vs Copy**: Understanding memory management
