# Tensor - Core Data Structure

Welcome to the Tensor module! This is where TinyTorch really begins. You'll implement the fundamental data structure that powers all ML systems.

```{admonition} 🎯 Learning Goals
:class: tip
- Understand tensors as N-dimensional arrays with ML-specific operations
- Implement a complete Tensor class with arithmetic operations
- Handle shape management, data types, and memory layout
- Build the foundation for neural networks and automatic differentiation
- Master the NBGrader workflow with comprehensive testing
```


## Build → Use → Understand
1. **Build**: Create the Tensor class with core operations
2. **Use**: Perform tensor arithmetic and transformations
3. **Understand**: How tensors form the foundation of ML systems
