# Networks - Neural Network Architectures

Welcome to the Networks module! This is where we compose layers into complete neural network architectures.

```{admonition} 🎯 Learning Goals
:class: tip
- Understand networks as function composition: `f(x) = layer_n(...layer_2(layer_1(x)))`
- Build the Sequential network architecture for composing layers
- Create common network patterns like MLPs (Multi-Layer Perceptrons)
- Visualize network architectures and understand their capabilities
- Master forward pass inference through complete networks
```


## Build → Use → Reflect
1. **Build**: Sequential networks that compose layers into complete architectures
2. **Use**: Create different network patterns and run inference
3. **Reflect**: How architecture design affects network behavior and capability

## What You'll Learn
By the end of this module, you'll understand:
- How simple layers combine to create complex behaviors
- The fundamental Sequential architecture pattern
- How to build MLPs with any number of layers
- Different network architectures (shallow, deep, wide)
- How neural networks approximate complex functions
