# Module: Setup

```{div} badges
‚≠ê | ‚è±Ô∏è 1-2 hours
```


## üìä Module Info
- **Difficulty**: ‚≠ê Beginner
- **Time Estimate**: 1-2 hours
- **Prerequisites**: Basic Python knowledge
- **Next Steps**: Tensor module

Welcome to TinyTorch! This foundational module introduces the complete development workflow that powers every subsequent module. You'll master the nbdev notebook-to-Python workflow, implement your first TinyTorch components, and establish the coding patterns used throughout the entire course.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- **Master the nbdev workflow**: Write code with `#| export` directives and understand the notebook-to-package pipeline
- **Implement system utilities**: Build functions for system information collection and developer profiles
- **Use TinyTorch CLI tools**: Run tests, sync modules, and check development progress
- **Write production-ready code**: Follow professional patterns for error handling, testing, and documentation
- **Establish development rhythm**: Understand the build ‚Üí test ‚Üí iterate cycle that drives all TinyTorch modules

## üß† Build ‚Üí Use ‚Üí Master

This module follows TinyTorch's **Build ‚Üí Use ‚Üí Master** framework:

1. **Build**: Implement core utilities (hello functions, system info, developer profiles)
2. **Use**: Apply these components in real development workflows and testing scenarios  
3. **Master**: Understand how this foundation supports all advanced TinyTorch modules and establish professional development habits

## üìö What You'll Build

### Core Functions
```python
# Welcome and basic operations
hello_tinytorch()           # ASCII art and course introduction
add_numbers(2, 3)          # Foundation arithmetic operations

# System information utilities
info = SystemInfo()
print(f"Platform: {info.platform}")
print(f"Compatible: {info.is_compatible()}")

# Developer profile management
profile = DeveloperProfile(name="Your Name", affiliation="University")
print(profile.get_full_profile())
```

### System Information Class
- **Platform detection**: Python version, operating system, machine architecture
- **Compatibility checking**: Verify minimum requirements for TinyTorch development
- **Environment validation**: Ensure proper setup for course progression

### Developer Profile Class
- **Personalized signatures**: Professional code attribution and contact information
- **ASCII art integration**: Custom flame art loading with graceful fallbacks
- **Educational customization**: Personalize your TinyTorch learning experience

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have completed the TinyTorch installation and environment setup:

```bash
# Activate TinyTorch environment
source bin/activate-tinytorch.sh

# Verify installation
tito doctor
```

### Development Workflow
1. **Open the development notebook**: `modules/source/01_setup/setup_dev.py`
2. **Follow the guided implementation**: Complete TODO sections with provided scaffolding
3. **Export your code**: `tito export --module setup`
4. **Test your implementation**: `tito test --module setup`
5. **Verify integration**: `tito nbdev build` to ensure package compatibility

## üß™ Testing Your Implementation

### Comprehensive Test Suite
Run the full test suite to verify your implementation:

```bash
# TinyTorch CLI (recommended)
tito test --module setup

# Direct pytest execution
python -m pytest tests/ -k setup -v
```

### Test Coverage (20 Tests)
- ‚úÖ **Function execution**: All functions run without errors
- ‚úÖ **Output validation**: Correct content and formatting  
- ‚úÖ **Arithmetic operations**: Basic, negative, and floating-point math
- ‚úÖ **System information**: Platform detection and compatibility
- ‚úÖ **Developer profiles**: Default and custom configurations
- ‚úÖ **ASCII art handling**: File loading and fallback behavior
- ‚úÖ **Error recovery**: Graceful handling of missing files
- ‚úÖ **Integration testing**: All components work together

### Inline Testing
The module includes educational inline tests that run during development:
```python
# Example inline test output
üî¨ Unit Test: SystemInfo functionality...
‚úÖ System detection works
‚úÖ Compatibility checking works
üìà Progress: SystemInfo ‚úì
```

## üéØ Key Concepts

### Real-World Applications
- **Development Environment Management**: Like PyTorch's system compatibility checking
- **Professional Code Attribution**: Similar to open-source project contributor systems
- **Educational Scaffolding**: Mirrors industry onboarding and training workflows
- **System Validation**: Foundation for deployment compatibility (used in modules 12-14)

### Core Programming Patterns
- **NBDev Integration**: Write once in notebooks, deploy everywhere as Python packages
- **Export Directives**: Strategic use of `#| export` for clean package structure
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing resources and system incompatibilities
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Classes with clear responsibilities and professional interfaces
- **Testing Philosophy**: Comprehensive coverage with both unit and integration approaches

### TinyTorch Foundation
This module establishes patterns used throughout the course:
- **Module ‚Üí Package Mapping**: `setup_dev.py` ‚Üí `tinytorch.core.setup`
- **Development Workflow**: Edit ‚Üí Export ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Iterate cycle
- **Educational Structure**: Guided implementation with instructor solutions
- **Professional Standards**: Production-ready code with full test coverage
