# 12. Embeddings

```{admonition} Module Overview
:class: note
Converting tokens to dense vector representations that capture semantic meaning for language models.
```

## What You'll Build

In this module, you'll implement the systems that transform discrete tokens into rich vector representations:

- **Embedding layers** with efficient lookup table operations
- **Positional encoding systems** that enable sequence understanding
- **Embedding optimization** for memory-efficient vocabulary management
- **Performance profiling** for embedding lookup patterns and cache efficiency

## Learning Objectives

```{admonition} ML Systems Focus
:class: tip
This module emphasizes embedding table scaling, memory bandwidth optimization, and efficient vector representations.
```

By completing this module, you will be able to:

1. **Build embedding layers** with lookup tables that efficiently convert token indices to dense vectors
2. **Implement positional encoding** systems that capture sequence information for transformer models
3. **Understand embedding scaling** and how vocabulary size affects model memory and computational requirements
4. **Optimize embedding lookups** for cache efficiency and memory bandwidth utilization
5. **Analyze embedding trade-offs** between dimension size, vocabulary size, and model capacity

## Systems Concepts

This module covers critical ML systems concepts:

- **Memory scaling** with vocabulary size and embedding dimensions
- **Cache-friendly lookup patterns** for high-throughput embedding access
- **Memory bandwidth bottlenecks** in embedding-heavy language models
- **Parameter sharing strategies** for efficient vocabulary management
- **Vector representation efficiency** and storage optimization

## Prerequisites

- **Module 02 (Tensor)**: Understanding of tensor operations and indexing
- **Module 11 (Tokenization)**: Token processing and vocabulary management

## Time Estimate

**4-5 hours** - Comprehensive implementation with scaling analysis and performance optimization

## Getting Started

Open the embeddings module and begin implementing your vector representation systems:

```python
# Navigate to the module
cd modules/12_embeddings

# Open the development notebook
tito module view 12_embeddings

# Complete the module
tito module complete 12_embeddings
```

## Next Steps

After completing embeddings, you'll be ready for:
- **Module 13 (Attention)**: Multi-head attention mechanisms for sequence understanding

## Production Context

```{admonition} Scale Reality Check
:class: warning
GPT-3 has embedding tables with 600M+ parameters (50k vocabulary Ã— 12k dimensions). Understanding embedding systems is crucial for building scalable language models.
```

Modern language models rely heavily on efficient embedding systems:

- **Memory management**: Embedding tables often represent 20-40% of total model parameters
- **Bandwidth optimization**: Embedding lookups are memory-bandwidth bound operations
- **Distributed training**: Large embedding tables require sophisticated parameter sharding strategies
- **Inference efficiency**: Optimized embedding access patterns are critical for real-time language generation

Your embedding implementations provide the foundation for all transformer-based language models in TinyTorch.
