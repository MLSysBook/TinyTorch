# Compression & Optimization - Making AI Models Efficient

Welcome to the Compression module! This is where you'll learn to make neural networks smaller, faster, and more efficient for real-world deployment.

```{admonition} 🎯 Learning Goals
:class: tip
- Understand how model size affects deployment and why compression matters
- Implement magnitude-based pruning to remove unimportant weights
- Master quantization to reduce memory usage by 75%
- Build knowledge distillation for training compact models
- Create structured pruning to optimize network architectures
- Compare compression techniques and their trade-offs
```


## Build → Use → Optimize
1. **Build**: Four compression techniques from scratch
2. **Use**: Apply compression to real neural networks
3. **Optimize**: Combine techniques for maximum efficiency gains
