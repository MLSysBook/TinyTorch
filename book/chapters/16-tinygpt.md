# 🔥 Module 16: TinyGPT - From Vision to Language

```{div} badges
🔥 Language Models | ⏱️ 4-6 hours
```

**🎯 The Ultimate Framework Test: Does your vision framework work for language models?**

---

## 📊 Module Overview

- **Difficulty**: 🔥 Framework Generalization 
- **Time Estimate**: 4-6 hours for complete understanding
- **Prerequisites**: **Modules 1-15** - Your complete computer vision framework
- **Outcome**: **Complete GPT-style language model** using 95% TinyTorch components

After 15 modules, you've built a complete computer vision framework from scratch. Now comes the ultimate test: **Can the same mathematical foundations power language models?**

**Spoiler**: They absolutely can, and you'll prove it by building TinyGPT!

## 🔬 **The Framework Generalization Discovery**

### 💡 **What You'll Learn**

This module demonstrates the most important insight in modern ML:

> **The same mathematical foundations that power computer vision also power natural language processing.**

### 🧩 **Component Reuse Analysis**

```python
# What works unchanged from your vision framework:
from tinytorch.core.tensor import Tensor          # ✅ Same tensors
from tinytorch.core.layers import Dense           # ✅ Same dense layers  
from tinytorch.core.activations import ReLU, Softmax  # ✅ Same activations
from tinytorch.core.optimizers import Adam        # ✅ Same optimizers
from tinytorch.core.training import Trainer       # ✅ Same training loops
from tinytorch.core.losses import CrossEntropyLoss    # ✅ Same loss functions

# What's new for language (minimal extensions):
from tinytorch.tinygpt import CharTokenizer       # 🆕 Text preprocessing
from tinytorch.tinygpt import MultiHeadAttention  # 🆕 Sequence attention
from tinytorch.tinygpt import TinyGPT            # 🆕 Complete language model
```

**Result**: ~95% component reuse! This isn't just educational - it's how real ML frameworks work.

## 🏗️ **What You'll Build: Complete TinyGPT**

### **Architecture Overview**
```
Text Input → CharTokenizer → Embeddings → Multi-Head Attention → Transformer Blocks → Text Generation
```

### **Key Components**

#### **🔤 Character-Level Tokenization**
```python
tokenizer = CharTokenizer()
text = "Hello, TinyTorch!"
tokens = tokenizer.encode(text)  # [8, 5, 12, 12, 15, ...]
decoded = tokenizer.decode(tokens)  # "Hello, TinyTorch!"
```

#### **🧠 Multi-Head Attention**
```python
# The key innovation for sequence modeling
attention = MultiHeadAttention(d_model=128, num_heads=8)
attended = attention(sequence)  # Focus on relevant parts of input
```

#### **🔄 Transformer Blocks**
```python
# Stack of attention + feedforward (using your Dense layers!)
transformer_block = TransformerBlock(
    attention=MultiHeadAttention(d_model=128, num_heads=8),
    feedforward=Sequential([  # Your existing components!
        Dense(128, 512),
        ReLU(),
        Dense(512, 128)
    ])
)
```

#### **📝 Autoregressive Generation**
```python
# Generate text one character at a time
model = TinyGPT(vocab_size=100, d_model=128, num_layers=6)
generated_text = model.generate("Once upon a time", max_length=100)
```

- **Optimize memory usage** for sequence processing

---

## 🚀 **Key Insights You'll Discover**

### **💡 Mathematical Unity**
```python
# Same operations, different data:
# Vision: Dense(image_features, hidden_dim)
# Language: Dense(token_embeddings, hidden_dim)

# Vision: conv(images) → attention(feature_maps)  
# Language: embed(tokens) → attention(sequence)
```
