# Benchmarking - Systematic ML Performance Evaluation

Welcome to the Benchmarking module! This is where we learn to systematically evaluate ML systems using industry-standard methodology inspired by MLPerf.

```{admonition} 🎯 Learning Goals
:class: tip
- Understand the four-component MLPerf benchmarking architecture
- Implement different benchmark scenarios (latency, throughput, offline)
- Apply statistical validation for meaningful results
- Create professional performance reports for ML projects
- Learn to avoid common benchmarking pitfalls
```


## Build → Use → Analyze
1. **Build**: Benchmarking framework with proper statistical validation
2. **Use**: Apply systematic evaluation to your TinyTorch models
3. **Analyze**: Generate professional reports with statistical confidence
