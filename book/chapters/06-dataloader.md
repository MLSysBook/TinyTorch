# Module 6: DataLoader - Data Loading and Preprocessing

Welcome to the DataLoader module! This is where you'll learn how to efficiently load, process, and manage data for machine learning systems.

```{admonition} 🎯 Learning Goals
:class: tip
- Understand data pipelines as the foundation of ML systems
- Implement efficient data loading with memory management and batching
- Build reusable dataset abstractions for different data types
- Master the Dataset and DataLoader pattern used in all ML frameworks
- Learn systems thinking for data engineering and I/O optimization
```


## Build → Use → Reflect
1. **Build**: Create dataset classes and data loaders from scratch
2. **Use**: Load real datasets and feed them to neural networks
3. **Reflect**: How data engineering affects system performance and scalability

## What You'll Learn
By the end of this module, you'll understand:
- The Dataset pattern for consistent data access
- How DataLoaders enable efficient batch processing
- Why batching and shuffling are crucial for ML
- How to handle datasets larger than memory
- The connection between data engineering and model performance
