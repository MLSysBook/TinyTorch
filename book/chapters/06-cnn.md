## üß† Build ‚Üí Use ‚Üí Analyze

This module follows TinyTorch's **Build ‚Üí Use ‚Üí Analyze** framework:

## üìö What You'll Build

### Core Convolution Implementation
```python
# Conv2D layer: the heart of computer vision
conv_layer = Conv2D(in_channels=3, out_channels=16, kernel_size=3)
input_image = Tensor([[[[...]]]])  # (batch, channels, height, width)
feature_maps = conv_layer(input_image)  # Learned features

# Understanding the operation
print(f"Input shape: {input_image.shape}")     # (1, 3, 32, 32)
print(f"Output shape: {feature_maps.shape}")   # (1, 16, 30, 30)
print(f"Learned {feature_maps.shape[1]} different feature detectors")
```

### Complete CNN Architecture
```python
# Simple CNN for image classification
cnn = Sequential([
    Conv2D(3, 16, kernel_size=3),    # Feature extraction
    ReLU(),                          # Nonlinearity
    MaxPool2D(kernel_size=2),        # Dimensionality reduction
    Conv2D(16, 32, kernel_size=3),   # Higher-level features
    ReLU(),                          # More nonlinearity
    Flatten(),                       # Prepare for dense layers
    Dense(32 * 13 * 13, 128),        # Feature integration
    ReLU(),
    Dense(128, 10),                  # Classification head
    Sigmoid()                        # Probability outputs
])

# End-to-end image classification
image_batch = Tensor([[[[...]]]])  # Batch of images
predictions = cnn(image_batch)     # Class probabilities
```

### Convolution Operation Details
- **Sliding Window**: Filter moves across input to detect local patterns
- **Weight Sharing**: Same filter applied everywhere for translation invariance
- **Local Connectivity**: Each output depends only on local input region
- **Feature Maps**: Multiple filters learn different feature detectors

### CNN Building Blocks
- **Conv2D Layer**: Core convolution operation with learnable filters
- **Pooling Layers**: MaxPool and AvgPool for spatial downsampling
- **Flatten Layer**: Converts 2D feature maps to 1D for dense layers
- **Complete Networks**: Integration with existing Dense and activation layers

                      [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
                      [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],

```

## üéØ Key Concepts

### Real-World Applications
- **Image Classification**: CNNs power systems like ImageNet winners (AlexNet, ResNet, EfficientNet)
- **Object Detection**: YOLO and R-CNN families use CNN backbones for feature extraction
- **Medical Imaging**: CNNs analyze X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans for diagnostic assistance
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: CNN-based perception systems process camera feeds for navigation

### Computer Vision Fundamentals
- **Translation Invariance**: Convolution detects patterns regardless of position in image
- **Hierarchical Features**: Early layers detect edges, later layers detect objects and concepts
- **Parameter Efficiency**: Weight sharing dramatically reduces parameters compared to dense layers
- **Spatial Structure**: CNNs preserve and leverage 2D spatial relationships in images

### Convolution Mathematics
- **Sliding Window Operation**: Filter moves across input with stride and padding parameters
- **Cross-Correlation vs Convolution**: Deep learning typically uses cross-correlation operation
- **Feature Map Computation**: Output[i,j] = sum(input[i:i+k, j:j+k] * filter)
- **Receptive Field**: Region of input that influences each output activation

### CNN Architecture Patterns
- **Feature Extraction**: Convolution + ReLU + Pooling blocks extract hierarchical features
- **Classification Head**: Flatten + Dense layers perform final classification
- **Progressive Filtering**: Increasing filter count with decreasing spatial dimensions
- **Skip Connections**: Advanced architectures add residual connections for deeper networks
