## Overview
This module teaches students to make neural networks smaller, faster, and more efficient for real-world deployment. Students implement four core compression techniques and learn to balance accuracy with efficiency.

## Learning Goals
- Understand model size and deployment constraints in real systems
- Implement magnitude-based pruning to remove unimportant weights
- Master quantization for 75% memory reduction (FP32 ‚Üí INT8)
- Build knowledge distillation for training compact models
- Create structured pruning to optimize network architectures
- Compare compression techniques and their trade-offs

## Educational Flow

### Step 1: Understanding Model Size
