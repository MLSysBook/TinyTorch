# 🔥 TinyTorch: Build ML Systems from Scratch

**A comprehensive, hands-on course for building machine learning systems from the ground up**

```{note}
This is an **interactive course** - you can run all code examples directly in your browser using Binder or download notebooks to run locally!
```

## 🎯 What You'll Build

By the end of this course, you'll have implemented a complete ML framework from scratch, including:

- **Core tensor operations** and automatic differentiation
- **Neural network layers** and architectures  
- **Training pipelines** with optimizers and loss functions
- **Convolutional networks** for computer vision
- **Production systems** with compression and monitoring

## 🚀 Interactive Learning Experience

### 📚 **Multiple Ways to Learn**
- **Read**: Rich explanations with mathematical foundations
- **Code**: Hands-on implementation in every chapter
- **Execute**: Run code interactively with Binder/Colab
- **Download**: Work locally with full Jupyter notebooks

### 🛠️ **Progressive Implementation**
Each module builds on the previous ones:

**Foundation → Building Blocks → Training Systems → Production**

## 🎓 Learning Philosophy: "Build → Use → Understand"

Every chapter follows this proven pedagogical pattern:

1. **🏗️ Build**: Implement core functionality from scratch
2. **🎯 Use**: Apply your implementation to real problems
3. **🧠 Understand**: Reflect on design decisions and trade-offs

This approach ensures you gain both practical skills and deep conceptual understanding.

## 📖 Course Structure

The course is organized into four main parts:

### 🏗️ **Foundation** (Chapters 0-2)
Essential building blocks for any ML system
- System setup and configuration
- Tensor data structures and operations
- Mathematical activation functions

### 🧱 **Building Blocks** (Chapters 3-5)
Core neural network components
- Dense and convolutional layers
- Network architectures and composition
- Computer vision with CNNs

### 🎯 **Training Systems** (Chapters 6-9)
Complete training pipelines
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Automatic differentiation engines
- Optimization algorithms and training loops

### ⚡ **Production & Performance** (Chapters 10-13)
Real-world deployment considerations
- Model compression and efficiency
- Custom kernels and acceleration
- Performance benchmarking and monitoring
