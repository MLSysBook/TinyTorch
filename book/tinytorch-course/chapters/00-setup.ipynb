        "Before we test your implementation, let's understand why testing is crucial in ML systems:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Reliability**\n",
        "- **Function correctness**: Does your code do what it's supposed to?\n",
        "- **Edge case handling**: What happens with unexpected inputs?\n",
        "- **Error detection**: Catch bugs before they cause problems\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Reproducibility**\n",
        "- **Consistent behavior**: Same inputs always produce same outputs\n",
        "- **Environment validation**: Ensure setup works across different systems\n",
        "- **Regression prevention**: New changes don't break existing functionality\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Professional Development**\n",
        "- **Code quality**: Well-tested code is maintainable code\n",
        "- **Collaboration**: Others can trust and extend your work\n",
        "- **Documentation**: Tests serve as executable documentation\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **ML-Specific Concerns**\n",
        "- **Data validation**: Ensure data types and shapes are correct\n",
        "- **Performance verification**: Check that optimizations work\n",
        "- **System compatibility**: Verify cross-platform behavior\n",
        "\n",
        "### Testing Strategy\n",
        "We'll use comprehensive testing that checks:\n",
        "- **Return types**: Are outputs the correct data types?\n",
        "- **Required fields**: Are all expected keys present?\n",
