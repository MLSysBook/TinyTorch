# Tensors: Core Data Structure

Welcome to the heart of TinyTorch! This chapter implements the fundamental data structure that powers all machine learning systems.

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Learn
- Understand tensors as N-dimensional arrays with ML-specific operations
- Implement a complete Tensor class with arithmetic operations
- Handle shape management, data types, and memory layout
- Build the foundation for neural networks and automatic differentiation

## ðŸ“Š Chapter Status
ðŸš§ **Under Development** - Converting from `modules/source/01_tensor/tensor_dev.py`

This interactive chapter will include:
- **ðŸ“– Conceptual foundations** of tensor mathematics
- **ðŸ’» Step-by-step implementation** of the Tensor class
- **ðŸ§ª Interactive code examples** you can run and modify
- **ðŸŽ¯ Real-world applications** in machine learning

## ðŸš€ Coming Soon
Full interactive notebook with:
- Executable code cells for hands-on learning
- Visual demonstrations of tensor operations
- Integration with the complete TinyTorch framework

*Check back soon for the complete interactive experience!*
