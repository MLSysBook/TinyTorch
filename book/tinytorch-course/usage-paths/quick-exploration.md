## 📚 Recommended Exploration Path

### **Start Here: Chapter 0 - Setup**
- Understand the TinyTorch development workflow
- Get familiar with the educational approach
- See how components fit together

**🚀 [Launch Setup Chapter](../chapters/00-setup.md)**

### **Then Try: Chapter 2 - Activations** 
- Implement your first ML function (ReLU)
- See immediate visual results
- Understand why nonlinearity matters

**🚀 [Launch Activations Chapter](../chapters/02-activations.md)**

### **Build Up: Chapter 3 - Layers**
- Create the building blocks of neural networks
- Combine your ReLU with matrix operations
- See how simple math becomes powerful AI

**🚀 [Launch Layers Chapter](../chapters/03-layers.md)**

## ⚠️ **Important Limitations**

**Sessions are temporary:**
- Binder sessions timeout after ~20 minutes of inactivity
- Your work is **not saved** when the session ends
- Great for exploration, not for ongoing projects

**For persistent work:** Ready to build your own TinyTorch? → **[Serious Development Path](serious-development.md)**

## 🎯 **What You'll Understand**

After exploring 2-3 chapters, you'll have hands-on understanding of:

✅ **How ML frameworks work under the hood**  
✅ **Why activation functions are crucial**  
✅ **How matrix multiplication powers neural networks**  
✅ **The relationship between layers, networks, and learning**  
✅ **Real implementation vs. high-level APIs**
