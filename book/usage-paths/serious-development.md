# 🏗️ Serious Development Path

**Perfect for:** "I want to build this myself" • "This is my class assignment" • "I want to understand ML frameworks deeply"

---

## 🎯 **What You'll Build**

A complete ML framework from scratch, including:
- **Your own tensor library** with operations and autograd
- **Neural network components** (layers, activations, optimizers)
- **Training systems** that work on real datasets (CIFAR-10)
- **Production features** (compression, monitoring, benchmarking)

**End result:** A working ML framework you built and understand completely.

## 🚀 **Quick Start (5 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Get the Code**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/tinytorch.git
cd TinyTorch
```

### **Step 2: Setup Environment**
```bash
# Activate virtual environment  
source bin/activate-tinytorch.sh

# Install dependencies
make install

# Verify everything works
tito system doctor
```

### **Step 3: Start Building**
```bash
# Open first assignment
cd modules/source/01_setup
jupyter lab setup_dev.py
```

### **Step 4: Build → Test → Export → Use**
```bash
# After implementing code in the notebook:
tito export               # Export your code to tinytorch package
tito test setup          # Test your implementation

# Now use YOUR own code:
python -c "from tinytorch.core.setup import hello_tinytorch; hello_tinytorch()"
# 🔥 TinyTorch! Built by: [Your Name]
```

tito system doctor          # Check environment health
tito system info           # Show module status

# Module development  
tito export                # Export dev code to package
tito test setup            # Test specific module
tito test --all            # Test everything

# NBGrader integration
tito nbgrader generate setup    # Create assignments
tito nbgrader release setup     # Release to students
tito nbgrader autograde setup   # Auto-grade submissions
```

### **Quality Assurance**
Every module includes comprehensive testing:
- **100+ automated tests** ensure correctness
- **Inline tests** provide immediate feedback
- **Integration tests** verify cross-module functionality
- **Performance benchmarks** track optimization

## 📊 **Proven Student Outcomes**

```{admonition} Real Results
:class: success
**After 6-8 weeks, students consistently:**

✅ Build multi-layer perceptrons that classify CIFAR-10 images  
✅ Implement automatic differentiation from scratch  
✅ Create custom optimizers (SGD, Adam) that converge reliably  
✅ Optimize models with pruning and quantization  
✅ Deploy production ML systems with monitoring  
✅ Understand framework internals better than most ML engineers  

**Test Coverage:** 200+ tests across all modules ensure student implementations work
```

## 🎯 **Why This Approach Works**

### **Build → Use → Understand**
Every component follows this pattern:

1. **🔧 Build**: Implement `ReLU()` from scratch
2. **🚀 Use**: `from tinytorch.core.activations import ReLU` - your code!
3. **💡 Understand**: See how it enables complex pattern learning

### **Real Data, Real Systems**
- Work with CIFAR-10 (not toy datasets)
- Production-style code organization  
- Performance and engineering considerations
- Professional development practices

### **Immediate Feedback**
- Code works immediately after implementation
- Visual progress indicators and success messages
- Comprehensive error handling and guidance
- Professional-quality development experience
