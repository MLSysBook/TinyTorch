# Tiny🔥Torch: Build your own Machine Learning framework from scratch. 

**Learn ML by building your own PyTorch-style framework from the ground up. _Start small. Go deep._**

```{admonition} 🎯 What You'll Achieve
:class: tip
By the end of this course, you'll have **built your own complete ML framework** that can:
- ✅ Train neural networks on CIFAR-10 images (real dataset!)
- ✅ Implement automatic differentiation (the "magic" behind PyTorch)  
- ✅ Optimize models for production deployment (75% size reduction)
- ✅ Handle the complete ML pipeline from data loading to monitoring

**Most importantly:** You'll understand how modern ML frameworks *actually* work under the hood.
```

## 📚 Educational Foundation

TinyTorch grew out of the CS249r: Tiny Machine Learning Systems course at Harvard University. While the [Machine Learning Systems book](https://mlsysbook.ai) covers the broad principles and practices of engineering ML systems, TinyTorch gives you hands-on experience building the systems yourself.

## 🎓 Learning Philosophy: Build → Use → Understand

### **Example: How You'll Learn Activation Functions**

**🔧 Build:** Implement ReLU from scratch
```python
def relu(x):
    # YOU implement this function
    return ???  # What should this be?
```

**🚀 Use:** Immediately use your own code
```python
from tinytorch.core.activations import ReLU  # YOUR implementation!
layer = ReLU()
output = layer.forward(input_tensor)  # Your code working!
```

**💡 Understand:** See it working in real networks
```python
# Your ReLU is now part of a real neural network
model = Sequential([
    Dense(784, 128),
    ReLU(),           # <-- Your implementation
    Dense(128, 10)
])
```

**This pattern repeats for every component** - you build it, use it immediately, then see how it fits into larger systems.

## 🏗️ **Big Picture: Why Build from Scratch?**

**Most ML education teaches you to *use* frameworks.** TinyTorch teaches you to *understand* them.

```python
Traditional ML Course:          TinyTorch Approach:
├── import torch               ├── class Tensor:
├── model = nn.Linear(10, 1)   │     def __add__(self, other): ...
├── loss = nn.MSELoss()        │     def backward(self): ...
└── optimizer.step()           ├── class Linear:
                               │     def forward(self, x):
                               │       return x @ self.weight + self.bias
                               ├── def mse_loss(pred, target):
                               │     return ((pred - target) ** 2).mean()
                               ├── class SGD:
                               │     def step(self):
                               └──     param.data -= lr * param.grad

Go from "How does this work?" 🤷 to "I implemented every line!" 💪
```

**Result:** You become the person others come to when they need to understand "how PyTorch actually works under the hood." Every line of code you write brings you closer to understanding how modern AI works.
