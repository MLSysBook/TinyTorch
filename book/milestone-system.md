## 📊 **Tracking Your Progress**

### **Visual Timeline**
See your journey through the ML systems engineering pipeline:

```
Foundation → Architecture → Training → Inference → Serving
```

Each milestone represents a major capability unlock in your ML framework.

### **Ticker Progress**
Within each milestone, track granular progress through individual modules:

```
🎯 Neural Architecture ████████▓▓▓▓ 66%
   ✅ Layers       ✅ Dense       🔄 Spatial      ⏳ Attention
```

### **Capability Statements**
Every milestone completion unlocks a concrete capability:
- ✅ "I can build mathematical operations and ML primitives"
- ✅ "I can design and construct any neural network architecture"  
- 🔄 "I can train neural networks on real datasets"
- ⏳ "I can deploy optimized models for production inference"
- ⏳ "I have built a complete, production-ready ML framework"

## 🛠️ **Using the Milestone System**

### **CLI Commands**

#### **Check Your Progress**
```bash
tito milestone status           # Current progress overview
tito milestone status --detailed # Module-level detail
```

#### **Visual Timeline**
```bash
tito milestone timeline         # Vertical tree view
tito milestone timeline --horizontal # Linear progress bar
```

#### **Test Capabilities** (Coming Soon)
```bash
tito milestone test foundation  # Test foundation capabilities
tito milestone unlock          # Attempt to unlock next milestone
```

### **Integration with Development**
The milestone system connects directly to your actual development work:
- **Module completion** automatically updates milestone progress
- **Integration tests** validate that capabilities actually work
- **Package building** ensures your framework grows with each milestone

## 🧠 **Why This Approach Works**

### **Systems Thinking Over Task Completion**
Traditional approach: *"I finished Module 3"*  
Milestone approach: *"My framework can now build neural networks"*

### **Clear Learning Goals**
Every module contributes to a **concrete system capability** rather than abstract completion.

### **Motivation Through Progress**
- **Visual feedback** shows your growing ML framework
- **Capability unlocks** feel like real achievements  
- **Clear direction** toward complete ML systems mastery

### **Real-World Relevance**
The milestone progression **Foundation → Architecture → Training → Inference → Serving** mirrors the actual ML engineering workflow in production systems.
