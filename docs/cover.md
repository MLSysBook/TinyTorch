### From Tensors to Transformers in 20 Modules

Build your own machine learning framework from first principles. Understand memory, performance, and production ML systems by implementing PyTorch's core components yourself.

---

**Course Highlights:**
- 🔥 20 interactive modules taking you from basic tensors to production transformers
- 🎯 60-80 hours of hands-on implementation experience
- 📊 Real datasets, real benchmarks, real systems thinking
- 🏆 Recreate 70 years of ML breakthroughs (1958-2025)
- ⚡ Pure Python + NumPy — no GPU required

---

**What You'll Build:**
- Complete Tensor class with broadcasting and autograd
- Neural network layers, activations, and loss functions
- Backpropagation and optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam)
- Training loops with batching and data loading
- CNNs for computer vision (CIFAR-10 classification)
- Transformers for language modeling
- Production optimizations: profiling, quantization, compression
- MLPerf®-inspired benchmarking and competition framework
