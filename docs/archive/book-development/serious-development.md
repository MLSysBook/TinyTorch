# Serious Development Path

**Perfect for:** "I want to build this myself" • "This is my class assignment" • "I want to understand ML frameworks deeply"

## What You'll Build

A complete ML framework from scratch, including:
- **Your own tensor library** with operations and autograd
- **Neural network components** (layers, activations, optimizers)
- **Training systems** that work on real datasets (CIFAR-10)
- **Production features** (compression, monitoring, benchmarking)
- **Language models** that extend your vision framework to TinyGPT

**End result:** A working ML framework that powers both computer vision AND language models.

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get the Code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/tinytorch.git
cd TinyTorch
```

### Step 2: Setup Environment
```bash
# Activate virtual environment  
source bin/activate-tinytorch.sh

# Install dependencies
make install

# Verify everything works
tito system doctor
```

### Step 3: Start Building
```bash
# Open first assignment
cd modules/01_setup
jupyter lab setup_dev.py
```

### Step 4: Build → Test → Export → Use
```bash
# After implementing code in the notebook:
tito export               # Export your code to tinytorch package
tito test setup          # Test your implementation

# Now use YOUR own code:
python -c "from tinytorch.core.setup import hello_tinytorch; hello_tinytorch()"
# 🔥 TinyTorch! Built by: [Your Name]
```

## Development Workflow

### The `tito` CLI System
TinyTorch includes a complete CLI for professional development:

```bash
# System management
tito system doctor          # Check environment health
tito system info           # Show module status

# Module development  
tito export                # Export dev code to package
tito test setup            # Test specific module
tito test --all            # Test everything

# NBGrader integration
tito nbgrader generate setup    # Create assignments
tito nbgrader release setup     # Release to students
tito nbgrader autograde setup   # Auto-grade submissions
```

### Quality Assurance
Every module includes comprehensive testing:
- **100+ automated tests** ensure correctness
- **Inline tests** provide immediate feedback
- **Integration tests** verify cross-module functionality
- **Performance benchmarks** track optimization

## Proven Student Outcomes

```{admonition} Real Results
:class: success
**After 6-8 weeks, students consistently:**

✅ Build multi-layer perceptrons that classify CIFAR-10 images  
✅ Implement automatic differentiation from scratch  
✅ Create custom optimizers (SGD, Adam) that converge reliably  
✅ Optimize models with pruning and quantization  
✅ Deploy production ML systems with monitoring  
✅ Understand framework internals better than most ML engineers  
🔥 **Extend their vision framework to language models with 95% reuse**  

**Test Coverage:** 200+ tests across all modules ensure student implementations work
```

## Why This Approach Works

### Build → Use → Understand
Every component follows this pattern:

1. **🔧 Build**: Implement `ReLU()` from scratch
2. **🚀 Use**: `from tinytorch.core.activations import ReLU` - your code!
3. **💡 Understand**: See how it enables complex pattern learning

### Real Data, Real Systems
- Work with CIFAR-10 (not toy datasets)
- Production-style code organization  
- Performance and engineering considerations
- Professional development practices

### Immediate Feedback
- Code works immediately after implementation
- Visual progress indicators and success messages
- Comprehensive error handling and guidance
- Professional-quality development experience
