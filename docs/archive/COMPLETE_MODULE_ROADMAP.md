## **Key Design Principles**

### **1. Backward Design Philosophy**
Each module is designed with future needs in mind:
- **Tensors** (Module 2): Built with gradient support from day 1
- **Layers** (Module 4): Parameter management ready for optimizers
- **Training** (Module 10): Memory tracking for optimization modules
- **Transformers** (Module 14): KV structure ready for caching

### **2. Backend Dispatch Architecture**
```python
# Students run SAME code throughout
model.train()  # Uses appropriate backend automatically

# Module 1-14: Naive backend (for learning)
# Module 15+: Optimized backend (for performance)
# Zero code changes needed!
```

### **3. Progressive Optimization Journey**
- **Understanding through implementation** (Modules 1-14): Build with loops for clarity
- **Systematic optimization** (Modules 15-19): Transform loops into production code
- **Transparent acceleration**: Optimizations work automatically on existing code
- **Real-world techniques**: Learn optimizations used in PyTorch/TensorFlow

### **4. Historical Context**
Examples map to ML breakthroughs:
- 1957: Perceptron (Module 4)
- 1969: XOR Solution (Module 6)  
- 1998: LeNet (Module 9)
- 2012: AlexNet (Module 10)
- 2018: GPT (Module 14)
