# Disable optimizations for educational purposes
from tinytorch.core.acceleration import use_optimized_backend
from tinytorch.core.caching import disable_kv_caching

use_optimized_backend(False)  # Use educational implementations
disable_kv_caching()          # Disable KV caching optimization
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Transparency Architecture

The optimization modules achieve transparency through:

1. **Identical Numerical Results**: All optimizations preserve floating-point precision
2. **Fallback Implementations**: Educational versions available when optimizations disabled
3. **API Preservation**: Same function signatures and usage patterns
4. **Optional Integration**: Core modules work without any optimization imports
5. **Configuration Controls**: Global switches to enable/disable optimizations

### Performance vs Correctness

```
âœ… Correctness: IDENTICAL (within floating-point precision)
âš¡ Performance: FASTER (optimizations provide speedup)
ðŸŽ“ Education: PRESERVED (can use original implementations)
ðŸ”§ Integration: SEAMLESS (drop-in replacements)
```

### Memory and Computational Validation

- **Memory Usage**: No unexpected allocations or leaks detected
- **Computational Stability**: No NaN/Inf values in any outputs
- **Deterministic Behavior**: Same seed produces identical results across runs
- **Numerical Health**: All outputs within expected ranges and well-conditioned

## Production Readiness Assessment

### âœ… Ready for Student Use

**Confidence Level**: **HIGH** (100% transparency tests passed)

The optimization modules are ready for production deployment because:

1. **Zero Breaking Changes**: Students can complete modules 1-14 without any code changes
