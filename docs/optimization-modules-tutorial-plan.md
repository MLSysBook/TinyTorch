# TinyTorch Optimization Modules Tutorial Plan
## Modules 15-20: From Manual Optimization to Automatic Systems

## Overview: The Complete Optimization Journey

Students progress from manual optimization techniques to building intelligent systems that optimize automatically, culminating in a competition where their AutoML systems compete.

```
Manual Optimization (15-18) → Automatic Optimization (19) → Competition (20)
```

## Module 15: Acceleration - Speed Optimization

### **Connection from Module 14**
"Your transformer works but generates text slowly. Let's make it 10-100x faster!"

### **What Students Build**
- Transform educational loops into optimized operations
- Cache-friendly blocked algorithms
- NumPy vectorization integration

### **Key Learning Outcomes**
- Understand why educational loops are slow (cache misses, no vectorization)
- Build blocked matrix multiplication for cache efficiency
- Learn when to use optimized libraries vs custom code
- Create backend systems for transparent optimization

### **Module Structure Change**
- **NEW**: Show `OptimizedBackend` class upfront as the goal
- Students see where they're heading before learning the steps
- "Here's the elegant solution, now let's understand how to build it"

### **Performance Impact**: 10-100x speedup on matrix operations

---

## Module 16: Memory - Memory Optimization

### **Connection from Module 15**
"Operations are faster, but transformers still recompute everything. Let's be smarter with memory!"

### **What Students Build**
- `KVCache` class for transformer attention states
- Incremental attention computation (process only new tokens)
- Memory profiling and analysis tools
- Cache management strategies

### **Key Learning Outcomes**
- Memory vs computation tradeoffs

### **Performance Impact**: 50x speedup in autoregressive generation

## Module 17: Quantization - Precision Optimization

### **Connection from Module 16**
"Memory usage is optimized, but models are still huge. Let's use fewer bits!"

### **What Students Build**
- `Quantizer` class for FP32→INT8 conversion
- Calibration techniques for maintaining accuracy
- Quantized operations (matmul, conv2d)
- Model size analysis tools

### **Key Learning Outcomes**
- Numerical precision vs accuracy tradeoffs
- Post-training quantization techniques
- Hardware acceleration through reduced precision
- When to use INT8 vs FP16 vs FP32

### **Performance Impact**: 4x model size reduction, 2-4x inference speedup

---

## Module 18: Compression - Structural Optimization

### **Connection from Module 17**
"We're using fewer bits, but can we remove weights entirely?"

### **What Students Build**
- `MagnitudePruner` for weight removal
- `StructuredPruner` for channel/filter removal
- Basic knowledge distillation
- Sparsity visualization tools

### **Key Learning Outcomes**
- Structured vs unstructured pruning

### **Performance Impact**: 90% sparsity with <5% accuracy loss

---

## Module 19: AutoTuning - Automatic Optimization

### **Connection from Module 18**
"We have all these optimization techniques. Let's build systems that apply them automatically!"

### **What Students Build**
```python
class AutoTuner:
    def auto_optimize(self, model, constraints):
        """
        Automatically decide:
        - Which optimizations to apply
        - In what order
        - With what parameters
        - For what deployment target
        """
        pass
    
    def hyperparameter_search(self, model, data, budget):
        """Smart hyperparameter tuning (not random)"""
        pass
    
    def optimization_pipeline(self, model, target_hardware):
        """Build optimal pipeline for specific hardware"""
        pass
    
    def adaptive_training(self, model, data):
        """Training that adapts based on progress"""
        pass
```

### **Key Learning Outcomes**
- Automated optimization strategy selection
- Constraint-based optimization (memory, latency, accuracy)
- Hardware-aware optimization pipelines
- Smart search strategies (Bayesian optimization basics)
- Data-efficient training (curriculum learning, active learning)

### **Student Experience**
"I built a system that takes any model and automatically optimizes it for any deployment target!"

### **Scope Balance** (Not Too Complex)
- Focus on **rule-based automation** (if mobile → aggressive quantization)
- Simple **grid search** with smart pruning (not full Bayesian optimization)
- Basic **hardware detection** (CPU vs GPU vs Mobile)
- **Pre-built optimization recipes** that students can combine

## Module 20: Competition - AutoML Olympics

### **Connection from Module 19**
"You've built AutoTuning systems. Time to compete!"

### **What Students Build**
- Complete end-to-end optimized ML systems
- Submission package for competition platform
- Performance analysis reports
- Innovation documentation

### **Competition Categories**
1. **Speed Challenge**: Fastest to reach target accuracy
2. **Size Challenge**: Best accuracy under size constraints
3. **Efficiency Challenge**: Best accuracy/resource tradeoff
4. **Innovation Challenge**: Most creative optimization approach

### **Platform Concept**
```python
class CompetitionSubmission:
    def __init__(self, team_name):
        self.model = self.build_model()
        self.auto_tuner = self.build_autotuner()
        self.optimized = self.auto_tuner.optimize(self.model)
    
    def evaluate(self, test_data):
        """Automated evaluation on hidden test set"""
        return {
            'accuracy': self.measure_accuracy(test_data),
            'latency': self.measure_latency(),
            'memory': self.measure_memory(),
