- Use progressive disclosure (collapsible sections)
- Add visual scanning aids (icons, color coding, numbered lists)
- Implement "TL;DR" boxes for time-constrained users
- Create content "nutrition labels" (Time: 5 min, Difficulty: ⭐⭐, Outcome: Working ReLU)

#### Educational Framework Alignment
**Strategy Principle**: Content structure should reinforce learning methodology
- Each page follows "Build → Use → Reflect" structure
- Module content includes "Where this fits in the bigger picture"
- Cross-references show progression and dependencies
- Assessment integration (checkpoint system) visible throughout

## 4. Specific Page-Level Recommendations

### 4.1 intro.md (Homepage) - HIGH PRIORITY
