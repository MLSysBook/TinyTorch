# Module Metadata System

TinyTorch uses a comprehensive metadata system to track module information, learning objectives, dependencies, and implementation status. Each module contains a `module.yaml` file that provides structured information for CLI tools, documentation generation, and progress tracking.

## Overview

The metadata system enables:
- **Rich status reporting** with `tito status --metadata`
- **Dependency tracking** and prerequisite checking
- **Learning objective documentation** for educational purposes
- **Progress tracking** for students and instructors
- **Automated documentation** generation
- **Component-level status** tracking

## Metadata Schema

Each `module.yaml` file follows this comprehensive schema:

### Basic Information
```yaml
name: "module_name"
title: "Module Title - Brief Description"
description: "Detailed description of what the module teaches and implements"
version: "1.0.0"
author: "TinyTorch Team"
last_updated: "2024-12-19"
```

### Module Status
```yaml
status: "complete"  # complete, in_progress, not_started, deprecated
implementation_status: "stable"  # stable, beta, alpha, experimental, planned
```

**Status Values:**
- `complete`: Module is fully implemented and tested
- `in_progress`: Module is being actively developed
- `not_started`: Module is planned but not yet implemented
- `deprecated`: Module is no longer maintained

**Implementation Status:**
- `stable`: Production-ready, well-tested
- `beta`: Feature-complete but may have minor issues
- `alpha`: Basic functionality working but incomplete
- `experimental`: Early development, may change significantly
- `planned`: Not yet implemented

### Learning Information
```yaml
learning_objectives:
  - "Understand core concepts and their importance"
  - "Implement key algorithms and data structures"
  - "Apply knowledge to real-world problems"

key_concepts:
  - "Concept 1"
  - "Concept 2"
  - "Concept 3"
```

### Dependencies
```yaml
dependencies:
  prerequisites: ["setup", "tensor"]  # Must complete before this module
  builds_on: ["tensor"]               # Direct dependencies
  enables: ["layers", "networks"]     # Modules that depend on this one
```

### Educational Metadata
```yaml
difficulty: "intermediate"  # beginner, intermediate, advanced
estimated_time: "4-6 hours"
pedagogical_pattern: "Build → Use → Understand"
```

**Pedagogical Patterns:**
- `Build → Use → Understand`: Standard TinyTorch pattern
- `Build → Use → Reflect`: Emphasizes design trade-offs
- `Build → Use → Analyze`: Technical depth with profiling
- `Build → Use → Optimize`: Systems iteration focus

### Implementation Details
```yaml
components:
  - name: "ComponentName"
    type: "class"  # class, function, methods, system
    description: "What this component does"
    status: "complete"  # complete, in_progress, not_started
```

### Package Export Information
```yaml
exports_to: "tinytorch.core.module_name"
export_directive: "core.module_name"
```

### Testing Information
```yaml
test_coverage: "comprehensive"  # comprehensive, partial, minimal, none, planned
test_count: 25
test_categories:
  - "Basic functionality"
  - "Edge cases"
  - "Error handling"
```

### File Structure
```yaml
required_files:
  - "module_dev.py"
  - "module_dev.ipynb"
  - "tests/test_module.py"
  - "README.md"
```

### Systems Focus
```yaml
systems_concepts:
  - "Memory management"
  - "Performance optimization"
  - "Error handling"
```

### Real-world Applications
```yaml
applications:
  - "Neural network training"
  - "Computer vision"
  - "Natural language processing"
```

### Next Steps
```yaml
next_modules: ["next_module1", "next_module2"]
completion_criteria:
  - "All tests pass"
  - "Can implement basic functionality"
  - "Understand core concepts"
```

## CLI Integration

The metadata system integrates with the TinyTorch CLI:

### Basic Status Check
```bash
tito status
```
Shows module completion status with basic file structure information.

### Enhanced Status with Metadata
```bash
tito status --metadata
```
Shows comprehensive table with:
- Module status (complete/in_progress/not_started)
- Difficulty level
- Time estimates
- File structure status

### Detailed Metadata View
```bash
tito status --metadata
```
Also includes detailed metadata section showing:
- Learning objectives
- Dependencies
- Component status
- Key concepts
- Next steps

## Creating Module Metadata

### 1. Create the metadata file
```bash
touch modules/your_module/module.yaml
```

### 2. Use the template
Copy from an existing module or use the schema above.

### 3. Customize for your module
- Set appropriate status and difficulty
- List learning objectives
- Define dependencies
- Document components
- Set time estimates

### 4. Test the metadata
```bash
tito status --metadata
```
