# 🎓 Instructor Guide: TinyTorch Milestone Assessment System

## Overview: Capability-Based Assessment

The TinyTorch Milestone System transforms traditional module-based grading into **capability-based assessment**. Instead of grading 16 separate assignments, you assess 5 major milestone achievements that represent genuine ML systems engineering competencies.

## 📊 Assessment Framework

### Traditional vs. Milestone Grading

**Traditional Approach:**
- 16 individual module grades (often disconnected)
- Focus on code completion and correctness
- Students lose sight of the bigger picture
- Difficult to assess real-world readiness

**Milestone Approach:**
- 5 major capability assessments
- Focus on systems integration and real applications
- Students understand progression toward professional competence
- Clear mapping to industry-relevant skills

### The Five Assessment Milestones

| Milestone | Capability | Assessment Focus | Weight |
|-----------|------------|------------------|---------|
| **1. Basic Inference** | Neural network functionality | Mathematical correctness, architecture understanding | 15% |
| **2. Computer Vision** | Image processing systems | MNIST accuracy, convolution implementation | 20% |
| **3. Full Training** | End-to-end ML pipelines | CIFAR-10 training, loss convergence, evaluation | 25% |
| **4. Advanced Vision** | Production optimization | 75%+ CIFAR-10 accuracy, performance analysis | 20% |
| **5. Language Generation** | Framework generalization | Character-level GPT, architecture reuse | 20% |
