## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Strategic Planning & Architecture Design

**Participants**: Education Architect + Workflow Coordinator

**Duration**: Initial planning session

**Key Decisions**:
- **16-checkpoint structure** aligned with 17 TinyTorch modules (00-15 checkpoints for modules 01-16)
- **Capability-based progression** with clear "Can I..." questions for each checkpoint
- **CLI integration** using Rich library for visual feedback
- **Module completion workflow** combining export and testing

**Deliverables**:
- Checkpoint capability questions defined
- Module-to-checkpoint mapping established
- CLI command structure planned
- Implementation phases outlined

**Success Factors**:
- Clear alignment between educational goals and technical implementation
- Concrete, measurable capability statements
- Integration with existing TinyTorch infrastructure

### Phase 2: Technical Implementation

**Participant**: Module Developer

**Duration**: Core implementation phase

**Implementation Components**:

#### 2.1 Checkpoint Test Suite
- **16 individual test files**: `checkpoint_00_environment.py` through `checkpoint_15_capstone.py`
- **Capability validation**: Each test verifies specific ML framework capabilities
- **Rich output**: Tests provide celebration messages and capability confirmations
- **Import validation**: Tests ensure modules export correctly to package

```python
# Example: checkpoint_01_foundation.py
def test_checkpoint_01_foundation():
    """Validates tensor creation and manipulation capabilities"""
    from tinytorch.core.tensor import Tensor
    
    # Test tensor creation and arithmetic
    x = Tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    y = Tensor([[5, 6], [7, 8]]) 
    result = x + y * 2
    
    # Validation and celebration
    print("üéâ Foundation Complete!")
    print("üìù You can now create and manipulate the building blocks of ML")
```

#### 2.2 CLI Integration System
- **`tito checkpoint` command group** with multiple subcommands:
  - `status` - Progress overview with capability statements
  - `timeline` - Visual progress tracking (horizontal/vertical)
  - `test` - Individual checkpoint testing
  - `run` - Detailed checkpoint execution
  - `unlock` - Next step guidance

- **Rich library integration** for beautiful CLI output:
  - Progress bars and visual timelines
  - Achievement celebrations with panels
  - Color-coded status indicators
  - Structured information display

#### 2.3 Module Completion Workflow
- **`tito module complete` command** integrating:
  - Automatic module export to package
  - Module-to-checkpoint mapping logic
  - Capability test execution
  - Achievement celebration and next step guidance

```bash
# Workflow example:
tito module complete 02_tensor
# ‚Üí Exports 02_tensor to tinytorch.core.tensor
# ‚Üí Maps to checkpoint_01_foundation
# ‚Üí Runs capability test
# ‚Üí Shows achievement: "üéâ Foundation checkpoint achieved!"
```

**Critical Success Factor**: Module Developer immediately contacted QA Agent upon completion of each major component, ensuring immediate validation of work.
