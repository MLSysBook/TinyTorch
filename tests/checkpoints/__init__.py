"""
TinyTorch Package-Level Checkpoints

These tests validate integrated functionality progression.
Each checkpoint answers: "What complete system can I build now?"

Unlike module tests that verify individual components, checkpoints test
what students can actually build and run as they progress through TinyTorch.
