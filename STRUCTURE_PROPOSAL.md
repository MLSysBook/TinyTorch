# TinyTorch Structure Reorganization Proposal

## Current Problem
The current structure is confusing because we have "projects" that are really just parts of one big project (TinyTorch). This makes it unclear that students are building one cohesive ML system.

## Proposed New Structure

```
TinyTorch/
├── parts/                        # 🧩 System Components (was "projects")
│   ├── 01_setup/                # Environment & onboarding
│   ├── 02_tensor/               # Core tensor operations
│   ├── 03_mlp/                  # Multi-layer perceptron
│   ├── 04_cnn/                  # Convolutional networks
│   ├── 05_autograd/             # Automatic differentiation
│   ├── 06_data/                 # Data loading pipeline
│   ├── 07_training/             # Training loop & optimization
│   ├── 08_config/               # Configuration system
│   ├── 09_profiling/            # Performance profiling
│   ├── 10_compression/          # Model compression
│   ├── 11_kernels/              # Custom compute kernels
│   ├── 12_benchmarking/         # Performance benchmarking
│   └── 13_mlops/                # Production monitoring
├── notebooks/                    # 📓 Interactive Development
│   ├── 01_tensor_dev.ipynb      # Tensor development
│   ├── 02_mlp_dev.ipynb         # MLP development
│   ├── 03_cnn_dev.ipynb         # CNN development
│   └── tutorials/               # Step-by-step guides
├── tinytorch/                    # 🏗️ Compiled Package
│   └── core/                    # Generated from notebooks
├── docs/                         # 📚 Documentation
├── examples/                     # 💡 Working Examples
├── tests/                        # 🧪 Test Suite
└── bin/                          # 🛠️ CLI Tools
    └── tito.py                   # Main CLI
```

## Benefits of This Structure

### Clearer Mental Model
- **Parts**: Students understand they're building parts of one system
- **Progressive**: Each part builds on the previous ones
- **Cohesive**: Clear that everything works together

### Better Learning Flow
1. **Setup** (01_setup) - Get environment ready
2. **Core** (02-04) - Build fundamental components
3. **Engine** (05-07) - Build the training engine
4. **Optimization** (08-12) - Add performance features
5. **Production** (13) - Add MLOps capabilities

### Improved CLI Commands
```bash
# Instead of confusing "projects"
tito test --project tensor

# Clear "parts" 
tito test --part tensor
tito info --part tensor
tito submit --part tensor
```

## Migration Plan

### 1. Rename Directory
```bash
mv projects parts
```

### 2. Update CLI Commands
- `--project` → `--part`
- `projects/` → `parts/`
- Update all references in tito.py

### 3. Update Documentation
- README.md references
- Course guide references
- All documentation paths

### 4. Update Notebooks
- Development notebooks reference parts
- Tutorials reference parts
- nbdev configuration

## Example Usage

### For Students
```bash
# Clear progression through parts
cd parts/01_setup/
# ... work on setup

cd ../02_tensor/
# ... work on tensor operations

cd ../03_mlp/
# ... work on MLP implementation
```

### For CLI
```bash
# Test specific part
tito test --part tensor

# Check status of all parts
tito info

# Submit completed part
tito submit --part tensor
```

## Alternative Names

If "parts" doesn't feel right, other options:
- `components/` - System components
- `modules/` - System modules  
- `stages/` - Development stages
- `phases/` - Development phases
- `steps/` - Implementation steps

## Implementation

Would you like me to:
1. Create the new directory structure
2. Update the CLI commands
3. Migrate the existing content
4. Update all documentation references

This would make the learning journey much clearer - students are building one cohesive ML system, not separate projects!
