# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

Train a neural network on 32×32 color images.

## Quick Start

### 1. Random Baseline
```bash
python random_baseline.py
```
Shows untrained network gets ~10% (random chance).

### 2. Train
```bash
python train.py
```
Trains network to ~55% accuracy in 2 minutes.

## Results

| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| Random (untrained) | 10% |
| Trained | 55% |
| **Improvement** | **5.5×** |

This proves the network learns real patterns from images.
