â””â”€â”€ tinytorch/              # Main package
```

### Analysis Tools Organization
- `instructor/tools/module_analyzer.py` - Main analysis tool
- `instructor/tools/report_generator.py` - Report card generator
- `instructor/tools/quality_monitor.py` - Continuous monitoring
- `instructor/reports/` - Generated report cards by date
- `instructor/guides/` - How-to guides for instructors

### Documentation Strategy
- **Quarto** for main documentation system
- **Automated generation** from source code and analysis
- **Multiple output formats** (HTML, PDF, etc.)
- **Integrated report cards** in documentation
- **Instructor and student** sections
