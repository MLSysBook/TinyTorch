## Key Features

### üîß TinyMLPerf Benchmark Suite
```python
from tinytorch.core.benchmarking import TinyMLPerf

# Load standard competition benchmarks
tinyperf = TinyMLPerf()
mlp_model, mlp_dataset = tinyperf.load_benchmark('mlp_sprint')
cnn_model, cnn_dataset = tinyperf.load_benchmark('cnn_marathon') 
transformer_model, transformer_dataset = tinyperf.load_benchmark('transformer_decathlon')
```

### ‚ö° Competition Profiling with Module 15 Integration
```python
from tinytorch.core.benchmarking import CompetitionProfiler

# Rigorous benchmarking using Module 15's profiler
profiler = CompetitionProfiler(warmup_runs=3, timing_runs=10)
results = profiler.benchmark_model(optimized_model, dataset, baseline_model)

print(f"Speedup: {results['speedup_vs_baseline']:.2f}x faster!")
```

### üèÜ Competition Framework with Leaderboards
```python
from tinytorch.core.benchmarking import TinyMLPerfCompetitionPlus

# Submit to competition
