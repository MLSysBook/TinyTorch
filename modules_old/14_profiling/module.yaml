description: "Build professional profiling infrastructure to measure and analyze performance.\n\
  Students learn to create timing, memory, and operation profilers that reveal\nbottlenecks\
  \ and guide optimization decisions. Performance detective work that \nmakes optimization\
  \ exciting through data-driven insights.\n"
