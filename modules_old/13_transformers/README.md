# Module 14: Transformers - Complete Transformer Architecture Implementation

## Overview
This module implements complete transformer architectures that power modern language models. You'll build LayerNorm, transformer blocks, and complete transformer models while understanding how architectural choices affect scalability, memory usage, and production deployment strategies.

## What You'll Learn

### Core Implementations
- **Layer Normalization**: Stable normalization for deep transformer training
- **Position-wise Feed-Forward**: Non-linear transformations for each sequence position
- **Transformer Blocks**: Complete transformer layers with self-attention and feed-forward components
- **Complete Transformer**: Full language model with embeddings, multiple layers, and generation capability

### ML Systems Concepts

## Usage Example

```python
from tinytorch.core.transformers import LayerNorm, TransformerBlock, Transformer
from tinytorch.core.attention import MultiHeadAttention
from tinytorch.core.embeddings import Embedding, PositionalEncoding

# Create complete transformer model
transformer = Transformer(
    vocab_size=10000,
    embed_dim=512,
    num_heads=8,
    num_layers=6,
    hidden_dim=2048,
    max_seq_length=512
)

# Process text through transformer
input_ids = tokenize("Hello, world!")
logits = transformer(input_ids)

# Generate text autoregressively
generated = transformer.generate(input_ids, max_new_tokens=50)
```

## Integration with TinyTorch

This module exports to `tinytorch.core.transformers` and provides the complete architecture for:
- **Language modeling** - GPT-style autoregressive language models
- **Text generation** - Efficient autoregressive text generation systems
- **Advanced architectures** - Foundation for BERT, T5, and other transformer variants

## Systems Engineering Focus

This module emphasizes the systems engineering aspects of transformer design:

### Memory Characteristics
- **Linear scaling**: Transformer memory scales linearly with depth
- **Parameter distribution**: Understanding how parameters are allocated across components
- **Training vs inference**: Different memory requirements for training and inference
- **Batch processing**: Memory scaling with batch size and sequence length

### Performance Considerations
- **Layer depth**: More layers improve capacity but increase memory and computation
- **Model width**: Embedding and hidden dimensions affect parameter count quadratically
- **Attention heads**: More heads improve representation but increase computation
- **Architecture trade-offs**: Balancing depth, width, and heads within resource constraints

## Prerequisites
- Module 02: Tensor (for matrix operations and data structures)
- Module 12: Embeddings (for token and positional representations)
- Module 13: Attention (for multi-head attention mechanisms)
- Understanding of layer normalization and residual connections

## Estimated Time
6-7 hours including implementation, testing, and architecture analysis

## Next Steps
