Core TinyTorch components.

This module contains the fundamental building blocks:
- utils: Utility functions 
- tensor: Core tensor implementation
- autograd: Automatic differentiation
- modules: Neural network layers
- optimizers: Training optimizers
- quantization: INT8 quantization for inference acceleration

All code is auto-generated from notebooks. Do not edit manually.
