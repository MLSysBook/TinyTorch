# 🏅 AI Olympics: TinyTorch Systems Competition Capstone

## **Core Concept: Compete on Systems Performance, Not Just Accuracy**

Instead of individual projects, Module 20 becomes a **competitive leaderboard** where students optimize their TinyTorch models across multiple **systems engineering dimensions**.

### **🎯 Why AI Olympics is Perfect for TinyTorch**

- **Systems Focus**: Compete on memory, speed, efficiency - not just accuracy
- **Real ML Engineering**: Production systems care about performance, not just "does it work"
- **Leaderboard Motivation**: Students naturally want to rank high and beat peers
- **Portfolio Value**: "I ranked #3 in TinyTorch AI Olympics" is impressive
- **Community Building**: Creates ongoing engagement beyond the course
