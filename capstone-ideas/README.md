# 🎓 TinyTorch Capstone Project Ideas

## **Background: The Capstone Design Problem**

**Original Issue**: Module 20 was "TinyGPT Capstone" but students can already build TinyGPT after Module 13 (Transformers). This made:
- Modules 14-19 (optimization) feel like "optional extras"
- Module 20 anticlimactic ("TinyGPT again?")
- No integration of crucial systems engineering skills

**Solution Requirements**:
- Must integrate ALL modules 1-19 (especially optimization modules 14-19)
- Must be genuinely exciting and different
- Must demonstrate complete ML systems engineering mastery
- Must create portfolio-worthy deliverables

## **🏆 RECOMMENDED: AI Olympics Competition**

**📁 See: [ai-olympics.md](ai-olympics.md)**

**Core Concept**: Competitive leaderboard where students optimize TinyTorch models across systems engineering dimensions.

**Why This is Best**:
- ✅ **Natural motivation**: Students want to rank high on leaderboards
- ✅ **Systems focus**: Compete on speed, memory, efficiency - not just accuracy
- ✅ **Community building**: Creates ongoing engagement and peer interaction
- ✅ **Portfolio impact**: "I ranked #3 in TinyTorch AI Olympics" is compelling
- ✅ **Forces optimization**: ALL modules 14-19 become essential for competitive performance

**Competition Categories**:
- 🏃‍♂️ **Speed Demon**: Fastest inference
- 💾 **Memory Miser**: Smallest memory footprint
- 📱 **Edge Expert**: Best Raspberry Pi performance
- 🔋 **Energy Efficient**: Lowest power consumption
- 🏆 **TinyMLPerf**: Overall benchmark champion

## **🛠️ Alternative Ideas Considered**

### **1. Edge AI Deployment System**
**Concept**: Deploy optimized neural networks to actual edge hardware (Raspberry Pi)

**Pros**:
- Integrates all optimization modules (essential for edge constraints)
- Creates tangible deliverable ("I run neural networks on a $35 computer")
- Teaches real-world deployment challenges

**Cons**:
- Individual project (no community/competition aspect)
- Hardware dependencies (students need Pi)
- Less motivating than competition

### **2. Multi-Modal AI Assistant**
**Concept**: Combine vision (CNNs) + language (transformers) + optimization for real-time performance

**Pros**:
- Showcases multiple architectures working together
- Demonstrates practical AI applications
- Requires optimization for real-time performance

**Cons**:
- Complex scope potentially overwhelming
- Optimization feels secondary to "getting it working"
- Limited portfolio differentiation

### **3. ML Performance Laboratory**
**Concept**: Comprehensive benchmarking suite comparing different ML frameworks

**Pros**:
- Heavy focus on profiling and benchmarking skills
- Creates useful tool for community
- Deep systems engineering focus

**Cons**:
- More about measurement than optimization
- Limited creative expression for students
- May feel academic rather than practical

### **4. Neural Architecture Search**
**Concept**: Automated model design and optimization system

**Pros**:
- Cutting-edge research area
- Requires sophisticated optimization
- Highly technical achievement

**Cons**:
- Very advanced, may be beyond course scope
- Optimization becomes means rather than end
- Difficult to assess fairly

### **5. Distributed Training System**
**Concept**: Multi-GPU/multi-node training infrastructure

**Pros**:
- Advanced systems engineering skills
- High industry relevance
- Impressive technical achievement

**Cons**:
- Requires expensive hardware
- Complex debugging and setup
- May overshadow core ML concepts

### **6. ML Model Marketplace**
**Concept**: Complete system for sharing/deploying/optimizing models (like Hugging Face)

**Pros**:
- Full-stack systems engineering
- Practical deployment focus
- Creates useful community resource

**Cons**:
- Web development skills needed
- Broad scope potentially unfocused
- Less emphasis on optimization techniques
