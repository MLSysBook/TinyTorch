> ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** - We're actively developing TinyTorch for Spring 2025! All core modules are complete and tested. Join us in building the future of ML systems education.

## Why TinyTorch?

**"Most ML education teaches you to _use_ frameworks. TinyTorch teaches you to _build_ them."**

In an era where AI is reshaping every industry, the difference between ML users and ML engineers determines who drives innovation versus who merely consumes it. TinyTorch bridges this critical gap by teaching you to build every component of modern AI systems from scratchâ€”from tensors to transformers.

A Harvard University course that transforms you from framework user to systems engineer, giving you the deep understanding needed to optimize, debug, and innovate at the foundation of AI.

## What You'll Build

A **complete ML framework** capable of:
- Training neural networks on CIFAR-10 to 75%+ accuracy (reliably achievable!)
- Building GPT-style language models  
- Implementing modern optimizers (Adam, learning rate scheduling)
- Production deployment with monitoring and MLOps

All built from scratch using only NumPy - no PyTorch, no TensorFlow!

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/mlsysbook/TinyTorch.git
cd TinyTorch
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# Start learning
cd modules/source/01_setup

## Learning Philosophy

**Most courses teach you to USE frameworks. TinyTorch teaches you to UNDERSTAND them.**

```python
# Traditional Course:
import torch
model.fit(X, y)  # Magic happens

# TinyTorch:
# You implement every component
# You measure memory usage
# You optimize performance
# You understand the systems
```

### Why Build Your Own Framework?

- **Deep Understanding** - Know exactly what `loss.backward()` does  
- **Systems Thinking** - Understand memory, compute, and scaling  
- **Debugging Skills** - Fix problems at any level of the stack  
- **Production Ready** - Learn patterns used in real ML systems  

## Key Features

### For Students
- **Interactive Demos**: Rich CLI visualizations for every concept
- **Checkpoint System**: Track your learning progress
- **Immediate Testing**: Validate your implementations instantly
- **Real Datasets**: Train on CIFAR-10, not toy examples
