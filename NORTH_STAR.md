## **"Don't Just Import It, Build It"**

## üéØ Our Mission

**Establish AI Engineering as a foundational engineering discipline, starting with training engineers who truly understand how to BUILD machine learning systems, not just use them.**

Just as Computer Engineering emerged as a critical discipline bridging hardware and software, **AI Engineering** must emerge as the discipline that bridges algorithms and systems.

In a world where everyone knows how to `import torch`, we're creating the first generation of true AI Engineers who know how to build PyTorch itself.

## üî• The Problem We're Solving

### The Current State
- **99% of ML practitioners**: Know how to use frameworks
- **1% of ML practitioners**: Know how to build frameworks
- **Result**: Critical shortage of ML systems engineers who understand the internals

### Why This Matters
When you only know how to import:
- You can't debug deep system issues
- You can't optimize for your specific use case
- You can't contribute to core ML infrastructure
- You're limited by what others have built

## üí° Our Solution: Build Everything From Scratch

### The TinyTorch Journey
Students build a complete ML framework, implementing:
1. **Tensors** - Understanding memory layout and operations
2. **Autograd** - Building automatic differentiation from scratch
3. **Neural Networks** - Creating layers, activations, losses
4. **Optimizers** - Implementing SGD, Adam, and beyond
5. **CNNs** - Building convolutions and spatial operations
6. **Transformers** - Creating attention mechanisms and GPT-style models
7. **Training Systems** - Complete training loops and data pipelines

### The Outcome
Students who complete TinyTorch can:
- **Read PyTorch source code** and think "I built this myself"
- **Debug complex ML systems** at the framework level
- **Optimize performance** because they understand the internals
- **Build new ML primitives** when existing ones don't suffice
- **Contribute to open source** ML frameworks with confidence

## üèóÔ∏è Our Pedagogical Philosophy

### 1. **Understanding Through Implementation**
We don't explain how Conv2d works - we BUILD Conv2d and discover how it must work.

### 2. **Systems Thinking From Day One**
Every module teaches:
- Memory implications
- Computational complexity
- Scaling behavior
- Production considerations

### 3. **Robust Learning Sandbox**
The framework is rock-solid so students focus on concepts, not debugging infrastructure issues.

### 4. **Progressive Complexity**
Start with simple tensors, end with complete transformers - each step builds on the last.

## üéì Who This Is For

### Primary Audience
- **CS Students**: Who want to understand ML at a systems level
- **ML Engineers**: Who want to go deeper than just using frameworks
- **Systems Engineers**: Who want to understand modern ML infrastructure
- **Researchers**: Who need to modify frameworks for novel architectures

### Prerequisites
- Basic Python programming
- Linear algebra fundamentals
- Willingness to build, not just use

## üöÄ Success Stories (Vision)

### Year 1
"I finally understand what happens when I call `loss.backward()`!"

### Year 2
"I contributed my first PR to PyTorch - I knew exactly where to look in the codebase."

### Year 3
"I'm now a core maintainer of a major ML framework. TinyTorch taught me how these systems really work."

### Year 5
"My startup's custom ML accelerator works because I understood how to build the software stack from scratch."

## üìä Success Metrics

We measure success by:
1. **Understanding Depth**: Can students explain how autograd works internally?
2. **Implementation Quality**: Can they build a working CNN from scratch?
3. **Systems Awareness**: Do they consider memory and performance?
4. **Career Impact**: Do they become ML systems engineers, not just users?

## üåç Long-Term Impact: AI Engineering as a Discipline

### The Discipline We're Establishing

**AI Engineering** - A new engineering discipline that encompasses:
- **Systems Design**: Building ML infrastructure from the ground up
- **Performance Engineering**: Optimizing for specific hardware and constraints
- **Reliability Engineering**: Ensuring AI systems work correctly at scale
- **Safety Engineering**: Building robust, interpretable, debuggable AI systems

Just as **Computer Engineering** gave us the professionals who build our computing infrastructure, **AI Engineering** will give us the professionals who build our AI infrastructure.

### The World We're Creating
A world where **AI Engineers**:
- **Design** AI systems architecture like computer engineers design computer architecture
- **Build** ML frameworks and infrastructure, not just use them
- **Optimize** AI systems for everything from data centers to edge devices
- **Innovate** at the intersection of algorithms, systems, and hardware
- **Lead** the development of safe, reliable, scalable AI infrastructure

### Why This Discipline Must Emerge Now
As AI becomes society's critical infrastructure:
- **We need a professional discipline** with standards, practices, and ethics
- **Custom AI hardware** requires engineers who understand the full stack
- **Safety and reliability** demand engineering rigor, not just research innovation
- **The future of civilization** may depend on how well we engineer AI systems

### TinyTorch's Role
We're not just teaching a framework - we're **founding a discipline**:
- Establishing what AI Engineers need to know
- Creating the pedagogical foundation for AI Engineering education
- Training the first generation who will define this field
- Building the educational infrastructure for a new kind of engineer

## üî≠ The Ultimate Test

**A TinyTorch graduate should be able to:**
1. Join the PyTorch team and contribute on day one
2. Build a custom ML framework for specialized hardware
3. Debug production ML systems at any level of the stack
4. Innovate new ML primitives when needed

---

## üìö Our Commitment

We commit to:
- **Maintaining a robust learning sandbox** where infrastructure "just works"
- **Teaching real systems engineering** not toy examples
- **Connecting to production reality** in every module
- **Building builders** not just users

---

## üéØ Remember Our Motto

# **"Don't Just Import It, Build It"**

Because the future belongs to those who understand how things work, not just how to use them.
