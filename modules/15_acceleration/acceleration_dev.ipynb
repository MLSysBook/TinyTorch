    "1. **Understand Why Loops Are Slow**: See why your Module 2/4 loops have poor performance\n",
    "2. **Implement Cache-Friendly Blocking**: Build blocked matrix multiplication that leverages CPU cache hierarchy\n",
    "3. **Visualize Memory Access Patterns**: Understand how cache misses destroy performance\n",
    "4. **Build Transparent Backend Systems**: Create automatic switching between implementations\n",
    "5. **Apply to Real Models**: Use these principles in MLPs, CNNs, and Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Free Speedup Journey\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Message**: This is the EASIEST optimization - just use better backends! No accuracy trade-offs, no complex math - just 10-100x faster code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Journey:**\n",
    "1. **Baseline**: Your loops from Module 2/4 (educational, 1000x slower)\n",
    "2. **Blocking**: Cache-friendly version (educational, 10x faster than loops)\n",
    "3. **NumPy**: Production version (optimal, another 10x faster)\n",
    "4. **Backend**: Smart switching system (transparent optimization)\n",

    "**Why This Works**: Same math, better implementation. Free performance with zero downsides!"

    "## 🤔 ML Systems Thinking: Interactive Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memory Access Pattern Analysis**: Your educational loops access `b[l, j]` in the innermost loop, creating terrible cache performance. Draw a diagram showing how this access pattern jumps around in memory, calculate the number of cache misses for a 1000×1000 matrix multiply, and explain why this creates exponentially worse performance as matrices get larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cache Hierarchy Optimization**: Your blocked implementation uses 64×64 blocks. Calculate: (a) Total memory footprint of three 64×64 float32 blocks, (b) Why this fits in L1/L2 cache, (c) Cache utilization ratio (reuses per cache miss), and (d) What happens with 256×256 blocks instead (hint: L3 cache limit).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Production Library Justification**: You implemented blocking for education, but NumPy beats it by another 10x. Identify three specific optimizations NumPy has (vectorization, BLAS libraries, assembly kernels) and calculate the development cost vs. performance benefit of implementing these yourself. Why is this a losing proposition for ML engineers?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **ML Model Acceleration Strategy**: You tested MLP, CNN, and Transformer operations. For each model type, identify: (a) The dominant matrix operations, (b) Which operations benefit most from acceleration, (c) Memory vs. compute bottlenecks, and (d) Why understanding the optimization spectrum makes you a better ML systems engineer."
