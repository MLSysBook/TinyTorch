assessment:
- Understand why naive loops have poor cache performance
- Implement cache-friendly blocked matrix multiplication showing 10-50x speedups
- Recognize why NumPy provides 100x+ speedups over custom implementations
- Build backend system that automatically chooses optimal implementations
- 'Apply the ''free speedup'' principle: use better tools, don''t write faster code'
