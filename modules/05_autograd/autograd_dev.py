# Autograd - Automatic Differentiation Engine

Welcome to Autograd! You'll build automatic differentiation step by step, giving your Tensor class the ability to compute gradients automatically for neural network training.

## 🔗 Building on Previous Learning
**What You Built Before**:
- Module 01 (Setup): Development environment ready
- Module 02 (Tensor): Complete tensor operations with math
- Module 03 (Activations): Functions that add intelligence to networks
- Module 04 (Losses): Functions that measure learning progress

**What's Working**: Your tensors can do math, activations, and loss calculations perfectly!

**The Gap**: Your tensors can't learn - they have no memory of how gradients flow backward through computations.

**This Module's Solution**: Enhance your existing Tensor class with gradient tracking abilities, step by step.

**Connection Map**:
```
Math Operations → Smart Operations → Learning Operations
(Pure Tensors)   (+ Autograd)      (+ Optimizers)
```

## Learning Objectives
1. **Incremental Enhancement**: Add gradient tracking without breaking existing code
2. **Chain Rule Mastery**: Understand how gradients flow through complex expressions
3. **Systems Understanding**: Memory and performance implications of automatic differentiation
4. **Professional Skills**: How to enhance software systems safely

## Build → Test → Use
1. **Build**: Six incremental steps, each immediately testable
2. **Test**: Frequent validation with clear success indicators
3. **Use**: Enable gradient-based optimization for training

## 📦 Where This Code Lives in the Final Package

**Learning Side:** You work in modules/05_autograd/autograd_dev.py
**Building Side:** Code exports to tinytorch.core.autograd

```python
# Final package structure:
from tinytorch.core.autograd import Tensor  # Enhanced Tensor with gradients
from tinytorch.core.tensor import Tensor    # Your original pure Tensor (backup)

# Your enhanced Tensor can do everything:
x = Tensor([1, 2, 3], requires_grad=True)   # New gradient capability
y = x + 2                                   # Same math operations
y.backward()                                # New gradient computation
```

**Why this matters:**
- **Learning:** Experience incremental software enhancement with immediate feedback
- **Production:** How real ML systems add features without breaking existing functionality
- **Professional Practice:** Safe software evolution patterns used in industry
- **Integration:** Your enhanced Tensor works with all previous modules

## Step 1: Teaching Our Tensor to Remember Gradients

Our Tensor class from Module 02 is perfect for storing data and doing math. But for training neural networks, we need it to remember how gradients flow backward through computations.

Think of it like teaching someone to remember the steps of a recipe so they can explain it later to others.

### What We're Adding

We need three pieces of memory for our Tensor:

1. **Should I remember?** (`requires_grad`) - Like asking "should I pay attention to gradients?"
2. **What did I learn?** (`grad`) - The accumulated gradient information
3. **How do I teach others?** (`grad_fn`) - Function to pass gradients backward

These three attributes will transform our mathematical Tensor into a learning-capable Tensor.

### Why Start Here?

Before we can compute any gradients, we need places to store them. This is the foundation - like preparing notebooks before a lecture.

## Step 2: Teaching Our Tensor to Learn (Backward Method)

Now that our Tensor has memory for gradients, we need to teach it how to accumulate gradients when they flow backward from later computations.

Think of this like teaching someone to collect feedback from others and combine it with what they already know.

### Gradient Flow Visualization

                            y.grad ←──── gradient
```

### The Backward Method

The `backward()` method will:
1. **Check if learning is enabled** (requires_grad must be True)
2. **Accumulate gradients** (add new gradients to existing ones)
3. **Propagate backwards** (tell earlier computations about the gradients)

```
    Gradient Accumulation Pattern:

    First call: tensor.grad = None
                tensor.backward([1.0])
                tensor.grad = [1.0]    ← Store first gradient

    Second call: tensor.backward([0.5])
                 tensor.grad = [1.5]   ← Accumulate: [1.0] + [0.5]

    Third call:  tensor.backward([2.0])
                 tensor.grad = [3.5]   ← Accumulate: [1.5] + [2.0]
```

This is the heart of learning - how information flows backward to update our understanding.

### Why Accumulation Matters

Neural networks often compute multiple losses that all depend on the same parameters. We need to collect ALL the gradients, not just the last one.

## Step 3: Smart Addition (x + y Learns!)

Now we'll make addition smart - when two tensors are added, the result should remember how to flow gradients back to both inputs.

Think of this like a conversation between three people: when C = A + B, and someone gives feedback to C, C knows to pass that same feedback to both A and B.

### Addition Gradient Flow

```

                        y.grad ←── 1.0

    Addition Rule: ∂z/∂x = 1, ∂z/∂y = 1
    Both inputs receive the same gradient!
```

### Mathematical Foundation

For addition z = x + y:
- ∂z/∂x = 1 (changing x by 1 changes z by 1)
- ∂z/∂y = 1 (changing y by 1 changes z by 1)

So gradients flow unchanged to both inputs: grad_x = grad_z, grad_y = grad_z

### Computation Graph Building

```
    Enhanced Addition Process:

    1. Compute: z.data = x.data + y.data    (math as before)

    2. If gradients needed:
       z.requires_grad = True
       z.grad_fn = lambda grad: {
           x.backward(grad)  ← Send same gradient to x
           y.backward(grad)  ← Send same gradient to y
       }

    3. Result: z remembers how to teach x and y!
```

### Why Enhancement, Not Replacement

We're enhancing the existing `__add__` method, not replacing it. The math stays the same - we just add gradient tracking on top.

## Step 4: Smart Multiplication (x * y Learns!)

Now we'll enhance multiplication with gradient tracking. This is more interesting than addition because of the product rule.

Think of multiplication like mixing ingredients: when you change one ingredient, the effect depends on how much of the other ingredient you have.

### Multiplication Gradient Flow

```
    Forward Pass:                    Backward Pass:

    x(2.0) ────┐                    x.grad ←── grad × y.data = 1.0 × 3.0 = 3.0
               ├─► [×] ──► z(6.0)           ↑
    y(3.0) ────┘              │             │
                               ▼             │

                               ▼
                        y.grad ←── grad × x.data = 1.0 × 2.0 = 2.0

    Product Rule: ∂z/∂x = y, ∂z/∂y = x
    Each input's gradient depends on the OTHER input's value!
```

### Mathematical Foundation - The Product Rule

For multiplication z = x * y:
- ∂z/∂x = y (changing x is multiplied by y's current value)
- ∂z/∂y = x (changing y is multiplied by x's current value)

```
    Why Product Rule Matters:

    If x = 2.0, y = 3.0, then z = 6.0

    Small change in x: x + 0.1 = 2.1
    New result: 2.1 × 3.0 = 6.3
    Change in z: 6.3 - 6.0 = 0.3 = 0.1 × 3.0 ← Scaled by y!

    Small change in y: y + 0.1 = 3.1
    New result: 2.0 × 3.1 = 6.2
    Change in z: 6.2 - 6.0 = 0.2 = 0.1 × 2.0 ← Scaled by x!
```

This means we need to remember the input values to compute gradients correctly.

### Why This Matters

Multiplication is everywhere in neural networks:
- Linear layers: output = input * weights
- Attention mechanisms: attention_scores * values
- Element-wise operations in activations

Getting multiplication gradients right is crucial for training.

## Step 5: Chain Rule Magic (Complex Expressions Work!)

Now comes the magic moment - combining our smart operations to see the chain rule work automatically through complex expressions.

When you build expressions like `z = (x + y) * (x - y)`, each operation tracks gradients locally, and they automatically chain together. This is what makes deep learning possible!

Think of it like a telephone game where each person (operation) passes the message (gradient) backward, and everyone modifies it according to their local rule.

### Complex Computation Graph

```
    Forward Pass: f(x,y) = (x + y) * (x - y)

    x(3.0) ────┬─► [+] ──► t₁(5.0) ──┐
               │                      ├─► [×] ──► result(5.0)
    y(2.0) ────┼─► [+] ──────────────┘  ↑
               │                         │
               └─► [-] ──► t₂(1.0) ──────┘

    Backward Pass: Chain rule flows gradients backward

    result.backward(1.0)
                    │
                    ▼
            [×] applies product rule:
            t₁.backward(1.0 × t₂.data) = t₁.backward(1.0)
            t₂.backward(1.0 × t₁.data) = t₂.backward(5.0)
                    │                         │
                    ▼                         ▼
            [+] sends to both:        [-] sends with signs:
            x.backward(1.0)           x.backward(5.0)
            y.backward(1.0)           y.backward(-5.0)
                    │                         │
                    ▼                         ▼
            Final gradients (accumulated):
            x.grad = 1.0 + 5.0 = 6.0  ← Matches ∂(x²-y²)/∂x = 2x = 6.0
            y.grad = 1.0 + (-5.0) = -4.0 ← Matches ∂(x²-y²)/∂y = -2y = -4.0
```

### The Chain Rule in Action

For f(x,y) = (x + y) * (x - y) = x² - y²:
1. Addition: passes gradients unchanged
2. Subtraction: passes gradients (first unchanged, second negated)
3. Multiplication: applies product rule
4. Chain rule: combines all effects automatically

Expected final gradients:
- ∂f/∂x = 2x (derivative of x² - y²)
- ∂f/∂y = -2y (derivative of x² - y²)

### Gradient Accumulation in Action

```
    Notice how x appears in BOTH addition and subtraction:

    x ──┬─► [+] ──► contributes to t₁
        │
        └─► [-] ──► contributes to t₂

    During backward pass:
    • Addition path contributes: x.grad += 1.0
    • Subtraction path contributes: x.grad += 5.0
    • Total: x.grad = 6.0 ← Automatic accumulation!

    This is why we need gradient accumulation - same parameter
    can contribute to loss through multiple paths!
```

### Why This Is Revolutionary

You don't need to derive gradients manually anymore! The system automatically:
- Tracks every operation
- Applies local gradient rules
- Chains them together correctly

### Question 1: Memory Management in Gradient Computation

Your autograd implementation stores references to input tensors through grad_fn closures. In a deep neural network with 50 layers, each layer creates intermediate tensors with gradient functions.

**Analysis Task**: Examine how your gradient tracking affects memory usage patterns.

**Specific Questions**:
- How does memory usage scale with network depth in your implementation?
- What happens to memory when you call `backward()` on the final loss?
- Why do production frameworks implement "gradient checkpointing"?

**Implementation Connection**: Look at how your `grad_fn` closures capture references to input tensors and consider memory implications for deep networks.

TODO: Analyze memory management in your gradient computation system.

Consider how your grad_fn closures store references to input tensors and
how this affects memory usage in deep networks.
"""
### BEGIN SOLUTION
# Memory management analysis:

# 1. Memory scaling with network depth:
# - Each operation creates a tensor with grad_fn that references input tensors
# - In 50-layer network: 50 intermediate tensors + their grad_fn closures
# - Each grad_fn keeps input tensors alive in memory
# - Memory grows O(depth) for intermediate activations

# 2. Memory behavior during backward():
# - Forward pass: Builds computation graph, keeps all intermediates
# - Backward pass: Traverses graph but doesn't immediately free memory
# - Python's garbage collector frees tensors after no references remain
# - Peak memory occurs at end of forward pass

# 3. Gradient checkpointing solution:
# - Trade compute for memory: store only subset of activations
# - Recompute intermediate activations during backward pass
# - Reduces memory from O(depth) to O(sqrt(depth))
# - Essential for training very deep networks

# Production implementations:
# - PyTorch: torch.utils.checkpoint for gradient checkpointing
# - TensorFlow: tf.recompute_grad decorator
# - Custom: Clear computation graph after backward pass

# Memory optimization strategies:
# 1. In-place operations where mathematically safe
# 2. Clear gradients regularly: param.grad = None
# 3. Use torch.no_grad() for inference
# 4. Implement custom backward functions for memory efficiency

### Question 2: Computational Graph Optimization

Your autograd system builds computation graphs dynamically. Each operation creates a new tensor with its own grad_fn.

**Analysis Task**: Identify opportunities for optimizing computational graphs to reduce overhead.

**Specific Questions**:
- Which operations could be fused together to reduce intermediate tensor creation?
- How would operator fusion affect gradient computation correctness?
- What trade-offs exist between graph complexity and performance?

**Implementation Connection**: Examine your operation functions and consider where computation could be optimized while maintaining gradient correctness.

"""
### BEGIN SOLUTION
# Computational graph optimization strategies:

# 1. Operation fusion opportunities:
# Current: z = (x + y) * w creates 2 tensors (intermediate + result)
# Optimized: Single "fused_add_mul" operation creates 1 tensor

def fused_add_multiply(x, y, w):
    """Fused operation: (x + y) * w"""
    # Direct computation without intermediate tensor

# 2. Safe fusion patterns:
# - Element-wise operations: add + mul + relu → single kernel
# - Linear operations: matmul + bias_add → single operation
# - Activation chains: sigmoid + multiply → swish activation

# 3. Gradient correctness preservation:
# - Fusion must preserve mathematical equivalence
# - Chain rule application remains identical
# - Numerical stability must be maintained

# 4. Trade-offs analysis:
# Memory: Fewer intermediate tensors reduces memory usage
# Compute: Fused operations can be more cache-efficient
# Complexity: Harder to debug fused operations
# Flexibility: Less modular, harder to optimize individual ops

# 5. Production techniques:
# - TensorFlow XLA: Ahead-of-time fusion optimization
# - PyTorch JIT: Runtime graph optimization
# - ONNX: Graph optimization passes for deployment
# - Custom CUDA kernels: Maximum performance for common patterns

# Example optimization for common pattern:
class OptimizedLinear:
    def forward(x, weight, bias):
        # Fused: matmul + bias_add + activation
        return activation(x @ weight + bias)  # Single backward pass

# Memory-efficient alternative:

# Gradient flow analysis:

# 1. Gradient magnitude changes by operation:

# Addition: z = x + y

# Multiplication: z = x * y
# ∂z/∂x = y, ∂z/∂y = x
