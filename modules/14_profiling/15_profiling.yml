  Build professional profiling infrastructure to measure and analyze performance.
  Students learn to create timing, memory, and operation profilers that reveal
  bottlenecks and guide optimization decisions. Performance detective work that 
  makes optimization exciting through data-driven insights.

learning_objectives:
  - Build accurate timing infrastructure with statistical rigor
  - Implement memory profiling and allocation tracking
  - Create FLOP counting for computational analysis
  - Master profiling methodology for bottleneck identification
  - Connect profiling insights to ML systems optimization decisions

prerequisites:
  - Module 14: Transformers (need models to profile)

skills_developed:
  - Performance measurement
  - Bottleneck identification
  - Profiling tool development
  - Statistical analysis
