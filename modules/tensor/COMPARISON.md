## 🎯 Key Educational Patterns

### Progressive Revelation
```python
# NBDev Way - Built-in
#| hide
def complete_solution():
    # Hidden by default, toggleable
    pass

#| code-fold: show  
def partial_solution():
    # Visible but collapsible
    pass
```

### Clean Learning Experience
```python
# NBDev Way - Built-in
#| filter_stream FutureWarning DeprecationWarning
import complex_library
# Students see clean output
```

### Instructor Mode
```python
# NBDev Way - Built-in
#| hide_line
print("Instructor note: explain this concept carefully")
print("Student sees this explanation")
```

## 📈 Impact on TinyTorch

## 💡 The Lesson

**Research first, build second.** 

We spent significant time building custom tools when the ML education community had already solved this problem with mature, powerful solutions.

NBDev's educational features are:
- ✅ More powerful than what we built
- ✅ Zero maintenance overhead  
- ✅ Industry proven
- ✅ Beautiful output
- ✅ Extensible ecosystem

Sometimes the best code is the code you don't have to write! 🚀
