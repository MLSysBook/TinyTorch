    "\n",
    "### What is Sigmoid?\n",
    "**Sigmoid** is a smooth S-shaped function that squashes inputs to the range (0, 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Definition:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties:**\n",
    "- **Range**: (0, 1) - never exactly 0 or 1\n",
    "- **Smooth**: Differentiable everywhere\n",
    "- **Monotonic**: Always increasing\n",
    "- **Centered**: Around 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Sigmoid is Useful\n",
    "1. **Probabilistic**: Output can be interpreted as probabilities\n",
    "2. **Bounded**: Output is always between 0 and 1\n",
    "3. **Smooth**: Good for gradient-based optimization\n",
    "4. **Historical**: Was the standard before ReLU\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Analogy\n",
    "Sigmoid is like a **soft switch** - it gradually turns on as input increases, unlike ReLU's hard cutoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications\n",
    "- **Binary Classification**: Final layer for yes/no decisions (spam detection, medical diagnosis)\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression**: The classic ML algorithm uses sigmoid\n",
    "- **Attention Mechanisms**: Gating mechanisms in LSTM/GRU\n",
    "- **Probability Estimation**: When you need outputs between 0 and 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Properties\n",
    "- **Derivative**: f'(x) = f(x)(1 - f(x)) - elegant and efficient!\n",
    "- **Range**: (0, 1) - never exactly 0 or 1\n",
    "- **Symmetry**: Sigmoid(0) = 0.5 (centered)\n",
    "- **Saturation**: Gradients approach 0 for large |x| (vanishing gradient problem)\n",
