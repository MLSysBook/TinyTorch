# Module 16: TinyGPT - Language Models

**From Vision to Language: Building GPT-style transformers with TinyTorch**

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

1. **Build GPT-style transformer models** using TinyTorch Dense layers and attention mechanisms
2. **Understand character-level tokenization** and its role in language model training
3. **Implement multi-head attention** that enables models to focus on different parts of sequences
4. **Create complete transformer blocks** with layer normalization and residual connections
5. **Train autoregressive language models** that generate coherent text sequences
6. **Apply ML Systems thinking** to understand framework reusability across vision and language

## What Makes This Special

This module demonstrates the **power of TinyTorch's foundation** by extending it from vision to language models:

- **~70% component reuse**: Dense layers, optimizers, training loops, loss functions
- **Strategic additions**: Only what's essential for language - attention, tokenization, generation
- **Educational clarity**: See how the same mathematical foundations power both domains
- **Framework thinking**: Understand why successful ML frameworks support multiple modalities

## Components Implemented

### Core Language Processing
- **CharTokenizer**: Character-level tokenization with vocabulary management
- **PositionalEncoding**: Sinusoidal position embeddings for sequence order

### Attention Mechanisms  
- **MultiHeadAttention**: Parallel attention heads for capturing different relationships
- **SelfAttention**: Simplified attention for easier understanding
- **CausalMasking**: Preventing attention to future tokens in autoregressive models

### Transformer Architecture
- **LayerNorm**: Normalization for stable transformer training
- **TransformerBlock**: Complete transformer layer with attention + feedforward
- **TinyGPT**: Full GPT-style model with embedding, positional encoding, and generation

### Training Infrastructure
- **LanguageModelLoss**: Cross-entropy loss with proper target shifting
- **LanguageModelTrainer**: Training loops optimized for text sequences
- **TextGeneration**: Autoregressive sampling for coherent text generation

## Key Insights

1. **Framework Reusability**: TinyTorch's Dense layers work seamlessly for language models
2. **Attention Innovation**: The key difference between vision and language is attention mechanisms
3. **Sequence Modeling**: Language requires understanding order and context across long sequences
4. **Autoregressive Generation**: Language models predict one token at a time, building coherently

## Educational Philosophy

This module shows that **vision and language models share the same foundation**:
- Matrix multiplications (Dense layers) 
- Nonlinear activations
- Gradient-based optimization
- Batch processing and training loops

The magic happens in the **architectural patterns** we add on top!

## Prerequisites

- Modules 1-11 (especially Tensor, Dense, Attention, Training)
- Understanding of sequence modeling concepts
- Familiarity with autoregressive generation

## Time Estimate

4-6 hours for complete understanding and implementation
