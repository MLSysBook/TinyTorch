    "## Part 1: Introduction - What is Attention?\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention is the mechanism that allows models to focus on relevant parts of the input when processing sequences. Think of it as a search engine inside your neural network - given a query, attention finds the most relevant keys and retrieves their associated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Attention Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "When you read \"The cat sat on the ___\", your brain automatically focuses on \"cat\" and \"sat\" to predict \"mat\". This selective focus is exactly what attention mechanisms provide to neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine attention as a library research system:\n",
    "- **Query (Q)**: \"I need information about machine learning\"\n",
    "- **Keys (K)**: Index cards describing each book's content\n",
    "- **Values (V)**: The actual books on the shelves\n",
    "- **Attention Process**: Find books whose descriptions match your query, then retrieve those books\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Attention Changed Everything\n",
    "\n",
    "Before attention, RNNs processed sequences step-by-step, creating an information bottleneck:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "RNN Processing (Sequential):\n",
    "Token 1 → Hidden → Token 2 → Hidden → ... → Final Hidden\n",
    "         ↓              ↓                      ↓\n",
    "    Limited Info   Compressed State    All Information Lost\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention allows direct connections between any two positions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Attention Processing (Parallel):\n",
    "Token 1 ←─────────→ Token 2 ←─────────→ Token 3 ←─────────→ Token 4\n",
    "   ↑                   ↑                   ↑                   ↑\n",
    "   └─────────────── Direct Connections ──────────────────────┘\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables:\n",
    "- **Long-range dependencies**: Connecting words far apart\n",
    "- **Parallel computation**: No sequential dependencies\n",
    "- **Interpretable focus patterns**: We can see what the model attends to\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Mathematical Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention computes a weighted sum of values, where weights are determined by the similarity between queries and keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k) V\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple formula powers GPT, BERT, and virtually every modern language model."

    "## 🤔 ML Systems Thinking: Attention Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1: Memory Scaling Impact\n",
    "You implemented scaled dot-product attention with explicit O(n²) loops.\n",
    "If you have a sequence of length 1024 with 8-byte float64 attention weights:\n",
    "- How many MB does the attention matrix use? _____ MB\n",
    "- For a 12-layer transformer, what's the total attention memory? _____ MB\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2: Multi-Head Efficiency\n",
    "Your MultiHeadAttention splits embed_dim=512 into num_heads=8.\n",
    "- How many parameters does each head's Q/K/V projection have? _____ parameters\n",
    "- What's the head_dim for each attention head? _____ dimensions\n",
    "- Why is this more efficient than 8 separate attention mechanisms?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3: Computational Bottlenecks\n",
    "From your timing analysis, attention time roughly quadruples when sequence length doubles.\n",
    "- For seq_len=128, if attention takes 10ms, estimate time for seq_len=512: _____ ms\n",
    "- Which operation dominates: QK^T computation or attention×V? _____\n",
    "- Why does this scaling limit make long-context models challenging?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4: Causal Masking Design\n",
    "Your causal mask prevents future positions from attending to past positions.\n",
    "- In a 4-token sequence, how many attention connections are blocked? _____ connections\n",
    "- Why is this essential for language modeling but not for BERT-style encoding?\n",
    "- How would you modify the mask for local attention (only nearby positions)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5: Attention Pattern Interpretation\n",
    "Your attention visualization shows weight matrices where each row sums to 1.0.\n",
    "- If position 2 has weights [0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.2], which position gets the most attention? _____\n",
    "- What would uniform attention [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25] suggest about the model's focus?\n",
    "- Why might some heads learn sparse attention patterns while others are more diffuse?"
