    return np.maximum(0, x_data)

def vectorized_operations(x, y):
    # Element-wise operations optimized for SIMD
    return {
        'multiply': x * y,
        'add': x + y,
        'squared_diff': (x - y)**2
    }
```

### **Step 3: Memory Layout Optimization**
```python

    return batch_results
```

### **Step 5: Performance Profiling**
```python
# Measure and optimize performance
profiler = SimpleProfiler()
result, metrics = profiler.profile(kernel_function, *args)
print(f"Wall time: {metrics['wall_time']:.4f}s")
```

### **Step 6: Compressed Model Kernels**
```python
# Hardware-optimized operations for compressed models
