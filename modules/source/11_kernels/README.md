- Implement matrix multiplication, convolution, and activations from scratch
- Understand the computational patterns underlying ML

### 2. **Use**: Performance Optimization
- Apply SIMD vectorization for CPU optimization
- Implement cache-friendly memory layouts
- Build GPU-style parallel computing concepts

### 3. **Optimize**: Real-World Integration
- Profile and benchmark performance improvements
- Integrate with compressed models from Module 10
- Bridge to production deployment considerations

## 📚 What You'll Build

### **Step 1: Understanding Custom Operations**
```python
# Move beyond NumPy to custom implementations
def matmul_custom(A, B):
    # Your low-level implementation
    return result

def relu_custom(x):
    # Understanding what happens inside activation functions
    return np.maximum(0, x)
```

### **Step 2: SIMD Vectorization**
```python
# CPU optimization with vector operations
def matmul_vectorized(A, B):
    # Use SIMD instructions for parallel computation
    return optimized_result
```

### **Step 3: Memory Layout Optimization**
```python

```

### **Step 4: GPU-Style Parallel Computing**
```python
# Understand parallel computing concepts
def matmul_parallel(A, B):
    # Parallel processing patterns
    return parallel_result
```

### **Step 5: Performance Profiling**
```python
# Measure and optimize performance
profiler = KernelProfiler()
profiler.benchmark(matmul_custom, matmul_vectorized, matmul_parallel)
```

### **Step 6: Compressed Model Kernels**
```python
# Hardware-optimized operations for compressed models
def quantized_matmul(A_int8, B_int8):
    # Optimized kernels for quantized models
    return result
