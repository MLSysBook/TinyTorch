    "# DataLoader - Efficient Data Pipeline and Batch Processing Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the DataLoader module! You'll build the data infrastructure that feeds neural networks, understanding how I/O optimization and memory management determine training speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "- Systems understanding: How data I/O becomes the bottleneck in ML training and why efficient data pipelines are critical for system performance\n",
    "- Core implementation skill: Build Dataset and DataLoader classes with batching, shuffling, and memory-efficient iteration patterns\n",
    "- Pattern recognition: Understand the universal Dataset/DataLoader abstraction used across all ML frameworks\n",
    "- Framework connection: See how your implementation mirrors PyTorch's data loading infrastructure and optimization strategies\n",
    "- Performance insight: Learn why data loading parallelization and prefetching are essential for GPU utilization in production systems\n",
    "\n",
    "## Build → Use → Reflect\n",
    "1. **Build**: Complete Dataset and DataLoader classes with efficient batching, shuffling, and real dataset support (CIFAR-10)\n",
    "2. **Use**: Load large-scale image datasets and feed them to neural networks with proper batch processing\n",
    "3. **Reflect**: Why does data loading speed often determine training speed more than model computation?\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Achieve\n",
    "By the end of this module, you'll understand:\n",
    "- Deep technical understanding of how efficient data pipelines enable scalable ML training\n",
    "- Practical capability to build data loading systems that handle datasets larger than memory\n",
    "- Systems insight into why data engineering is often the limiting factor in ML system performance\n",
    "- Performance consideration of how batch size, shuffling, and prefetching affect training throughput and convergence\n",
    "- Connection to production ML systems and how frameworks optimize data loading for different storage systems\n",
    "\n",
    "## Systems Reality Check\n",
    "💡 **Production Context**: PyTorch's DataLoader uses multiprocessing and memory pinning to overlap data loading with GPU computation, achieving near-zero data loading overhead\n",
    "⚡ **Performance Note**: Modern GPUs can process data faster than storage systems can provide it - data loading optimization is critical for hardware utilization in production training"
