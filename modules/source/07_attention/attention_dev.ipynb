    "## Step 1: Understanding Attention - The Revolutionary Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Attention?\n",
    "**Attention** is a mechanism that allows models to dynamically focus on relevant parts of the input. It is like having a spotlight that can shine on different parts of a sequence based on what's most important for the current task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Fundamental Insight: Query, Key, Value\n",
    "Attention works through three projections:\n",
    "- **Query (Q)**: \"What am I looking for?\"\n",
    "- **Key (K)**: \"What information is available?\"\n",
    "- **Value (V)**: \"What is the actual content?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Analogy: Library Search\n",
    "Imagine searching in a library:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Query: \"machine learning books\"     ← What you are looking for\n",
    "Keys: [\"AI\", \"ML\", \"physics\", ...] ← Book category labels  \n",
    "Values: [book1, book2, book3, ...]  ← Actual book contents\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention: Look at all keys, find matches with query, \n",
    "          return weighted combination of corresponding values\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Attention Formula\n",
    "```\n",
    "Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step by step:**\n",
    "1. **Compute scores**: `QK^T` measures similarity between queries and keys\n",
    "2. **Scale**: Divide by `√d_k` to prevent extremely large values\n",
    "3. **Normalize**: `softmax` converts scores to probabilities\n",
    "4. **Combine**: Weight the values by attention probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Is Revolutionary\n",
    "- **Dynamic weights**: Unlike fixed convolution kernels, attention adapts to input\n",
    "- **Global connectivity**: Any position can attend to any other position directly\n",
    "- **Interpretability**: Attention weights show what the model focuses on\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Works for sequences of varying lengths\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attention vs Convolution\n",
    "| Aspect | Convolution | Attention |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|-----------|\n",
    "| **Receptive field** | Local, grows with depth | Global from layer 1 |\n",
    "| **Computation** | O(n) with kernel size | O(n^2) with sequence length |\n",
