    "# Tensor - Core Data Structure and Memory Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Tensor module! You'll implement the fundamental data structure that powers all neural networks and understand why memory layout determines performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "- Systems understanding: How tensor memory layout affects cache performance and computational efficiency\n",
    "- Core implementation skill: Build a complete Tensor class with shape management and arithmetic operations\n",
    "- Pattern recognition: Understand how tensors abstract N-dimensional data for ML algorithms\n",
    "- Framework connection: See how your implementation mirrors PyTorch's tensor design and memory model\n",
    "- Performance insight: Learn why contiguous memory layout and vectorized operations are critical for ML performance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Build → Use → Reflect\n",
    "1. **Build**: Complete Tensor class with shape management, broadcasting, and vectorized operations\n",
    "2. **Use**: Perform tensor arithmetic and transformations on real multi-dimensional data\n",
    "3. **Reflect**: Why does tensor memory layout become the performance bottleneck in large neural networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Achieve\n",
    "By the end of this module, you'll understand:\n",
    "- Deep technical understanding of how N-dimensional arrays are stored and manipulated in memory\n",
    "- Practical capability to build efficient tensor operations that form the foundation of neural networks\n",
    "- Systems insight into why memory access patterns determine whether ML operations run fast or slow\n",
    "- Performance consideration of when tensor operations trigger expensive memory copies vs efficient in-place updates\n",
    "- Connection to production ML systems and how PyTorch optimizes tensor storage for GPU acceleration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Systems Reality Check\n",
    "💡 **Production Context**: PyTorch tensors automatically choose optimal memory layouts and can seamlessly move between CPU and GPU - your implementation reveals these design decisions\n",
    "⚡ **Performance Note**: Non-contiguous tensors can be 10-100x slower than contiguous ones - memory layout is often more important than algorithm choice in ML systems"
