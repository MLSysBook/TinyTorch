    "# Activations - Nonlinearity and Neural Network Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Activations module! You'll implement the functions that give neural networks their power to learn complex patterns through nonlinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "- Systems understanding: Why linear operations alone cannot solve complex problems and how nonlinearity enables universal approximation\n",
    "- Core implementation skill: Build the four essential activation functions that power modern neural networks\n",
    "- Pattern recognition: Understand how different activations affect gradient flow and learning dynamics\n",
    "- Framework connection: See how your implementations match PyTorch's optimized activation functions\n",
    "- Performance insight: Learn why activation choice affects both forward pass speed and gradient computation efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "## Build → Use → Reflect\n",
    "1. **Build**: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, and Softmax activation functions with proper numerical stability\n",
    "2. **Use**: Transform real tensor data and observe how different activations affect output distributions\n",
    "3. **Reflect**: Why does activation function choice determine whether deep networks can train successfully?\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Achieve\n",
    "By the end of this module, you'll understand:\n",
    "- Deep technical understanding of how nonlinear functions enable neural networks to approximate any continuous function\n",
    "- Practical capability to implement numerically stable activation functions that avoid overflow and underflow\n",
    "- Systems insight into why activation choice affects gradient flow and determines trainable network depth\n",
    "- Performance consideration of how activation complexity affects forward and backward pass computational cost\n",
    "- Connection to production ML systems and why modern frameworks provide dozens of activation variants\n",
    "\n",
    "## Systems Reality Check\n",
    "💡 **Production Context**: PyTorch implements activations as both functions and modules, with CUDA kernels for GPU acceleration - your implementation reveals the mathematical foundations\n",
    "⚡ **Performance Note**: ReLU is popular partly because it's computationally cheap (just max(0,x)), while Softmax requires expensive exponentials - activation choice affects training speed"

    "### Why Tanh is Better Than Sigmoid\n",
    "1. **Zero-centered**: Outputs range from -1 to 1\n",
    "2. **Better gradients**: Helps with gradient flow in deep networks\n",
    "3. **Faster convergence**: Less bias shift during training\n",
    "4. **Stronger gradients**: Maximum gradient is 1 vs 0.25 for sigmoid\n",
