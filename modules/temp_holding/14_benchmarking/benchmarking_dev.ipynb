    "When you build ML systems, you need to answer critical questions:\n",
    "- **Is my model actually better?** Statistical significance vs random variation\n",
    "- **How does it perform in production?** Latency, throughput, resource usage\n",
    "- **Which approach should I choose?** Systematic comparison methodology\n",
    "- **Can I trust my results?** Avoiding common benchmarking pitfalls\n",

    "2. **Dataset**: Standardized evaluation data (CIFAR-10, ImageNet, etc.)\n",
    "3. **Model**: The specific architecture and weights being tested\n",

    "#### 1. Single-Stream Scenario\n",
    "- **Use case**: Mobile/edge inference, interactive applications\n",
    "- **Pattern**: Send next query only after previous completes\n",
    "- **Metric**: 90th percentile latency (tail latency)\n",
    "- **Why**: Users care about worst-case response time\n",

    "#### 2. Server Scenario  \n",
    "- **Use case**: Production web services, API endpoints\n",
    "- **Pattern**: Poisson distribution of concurrent queries\n",
    "- **Metric**: Queries per second (QPS) at acceptable latency\n",
    "- **Why**: Servers handle multiple simultaneous requests\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Offline Scenario\n",
    "- **Use case**: Batch processing, data center workloads\n",
    "- **Pattern**: Send all samples at once for batch processing\n",
    "- **Metric**: Throughput (samples per second)\n",
    "- **Why**: Batch jobs care about total processing time\n",

    "### Mathematical Foundation\n",

    "## 🤔 ML Systems Thinking Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Benchmarking and Performance Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflect on how benchmarking connects to real-world ML systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### System Design and Architecture\n",
    "1. **Performance Isolation**: How would you benchmark individual components (model, preprocessing, postprocessing) separately versus end-to-end? What are the tradeoffs?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Distributed Systems**: How does benchmarking change when your model is deployed across multiple machines or in a microservices architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hardware Acceleration**: How would you adapt your benchmarking framework to properly evaluate models running on GPUs, TPUs, or specialized AI chips?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cache Effects**: How do data locality and caching (model weights, preprocessing results, etc.) affect your benchmarking methodology?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Production ML Operations\n",
    "5. **Performance SLAs**: If you had to guarantee 99.9% of requests complete within 100ms, how would you design your benchmarking to validate this requirement?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Load Testing**: How would you design benchmarks that simulate realistic production traffic patterns (bursts, seasonality, geographic distribution)?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Performance Regression**: In a CI/CD pipeline, how would you automatically detect when a new model version introduces performance regressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Cost Optimization**: How could your benchmarking framework help teams optimize cloud computing costs for ML inference?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Framework Design and Tooling\n",
    "9. **Framework Integration**: How would frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow implement similar benchmarking capabilities at scale?\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Observability**: How would you integrate your benchmarking with production monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, DataDog) for real-time insights?\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **A/B Testing Scale**: How would companies like Netflix or Meta extend your A/B testing framework to handle millions of concurrent users?\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Benchmark Standardization**: Why do you think industry benchmarks like MLPerf focus on specific scenarios rather than general-purpose testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance and Scale\n",
    "13. **Bottleneck Analysis**: When your benchmark identifies a performance bottleneck, what systematic approach would you use to determine if it's hardware, software, or algorithmic?\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Scaling Patterns**: How do different ML workloads (computer vision, NLP, recommendation systems) have different scaling and benchmarking requirements?\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Edge Deployment**: How would your benchmarking methodology change for models deployed on mobile devices or IoT hardware with limited resources?\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **Multi-Model Systems**: How would you benchmark systems that use multiple models together (ensembles, cascading models, multi-modal systems)?\n",
    "\n",
    "*These questions connect your benchmarking implementation to the broader challenges of production ML systems. Consider how the patterns you've learned apply to real-world scenarios at scale.*"
