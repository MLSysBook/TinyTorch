## Usage Example

```python
from tinytorch.core.attention import ScaledDotProductAttention, MultiHeadAttention
from tinytorch.core.embeddings import Embedding, PositionalEncoding

# Create attention mechanisms
scaled_attn = ScaledDotProductAttention()
multi_head_attn = MultiHeadAttention(embed_dim=256, num_heads=8)

# Process sequences with attention
query = key = value = embeddings  # Self-attention
output = multi_head_attn(query, key, value)

# Causal masking for generation
causal_mask = create_causal_mask(seq_length)
masked_output = multi_head_attn(query, key, value, mask=causal_mask)
```

## Integration with TinyTorch

This module exports to `tinytorch.core.attention` and provides the attention foundation for:

- **Language generation** - Efficient autoregressive text generation
- **Sequence modeling** - Advanced sequence processing architectures

## Systems Engineering Focus

This module emphasizes the systems engineering aspects of attention:

### Memory Characteristics
- **Quadratic scaling**: Attention memory = O(batch_size × seq_length²)
- **Memory bottleneck**: Attention often limits practical transformer sequence length
- **KV-cache benefits**: Reduces generation memory from O(N²) to O(N)
- **GPU memory limits**: Determines maximum feasible sequence lengths

### Performance Considerations
- **Matrix multiplication bound**: Attention performance limited by GEMM operations
- **Memory bandwidth**: Large attention matrices stress memory subsystem
- **Parallelization**: Multi-head attention enables parallel computation
- **Generation patterns**: Autoregressive vs parallel processing trade-offs
