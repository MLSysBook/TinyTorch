# Project Setup: Environment & Onboarding

Welcome to TinyðŸ”¥Torch! This setup project gets your development environment ready and introduces you to the workflow you'll use throughout the course.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will:
- âœ… Have a fully working development environment
- âœ… Understand the `tito` CLI workflow  
- âœ… Know how to check system status and run tests
- âœ… Have implemented your first TinyTorch component
- âœ… Be ready to build the entire ML system

## ðŸ“‹ Setup Checklist

### Step 1: One-Command Environment Setup

**The Only Command You Need** ðŸš€
```bash
bin/activate-tinytorch.sh
```

This smart script handles everything:
- ðŸ†• **First time**: Creates environment, installs dependencies, activates it
- ðŸ’¤ **Already exists**: Just activates the existing environment  
- âœ… **Already active**: Already good to go!

**Super Simple Workflow!** âš¡
```bash
# First time or any time - just run:
bin/activate-tinytorch.sh

# Then you're ready:
tito info      # Check system status
tito test      # Run tests
tito doctor    # Diagnose any issues

# When done:
deactivate     # Exit the environment
```

> **ðŸ’¡ Dead simple!** One script does everything - no setup commands, no complexity.

### Step 2: System Verification

**Test the CLI**
```bash
tito --version    # (after running bin/activate-tinytorch.sh)
tito info
```
You should see the TinyðŸ”¥Torch banner and system status.

**Check Project Structure**
```bash
tito info --show-architecture
```
This shows the system architecture you'll be building.

### Step 3: Development Workflow

**Learn Status Commands**
```bash
# Check implementation status
tito info

# Test specific project (you'll use this constantly)
tito test --project setup

# Get help on any command
tito --help
```

## ðŸš€ Hello World Implementation

Now let's implement your first TinyTorch component! You'll add a simple greeting function to the system.

**Your Task**: Implement a `hello_tinytorch()` function in `tinytorch/core/utils.py`

**Step 1: Open the utils file**
```bash
# Look at the current file
cat tinytorch/core/utils.py
```

**Step 2: Implement the function**

Add this function to `tinytorch/core/utils.py`:

```python
def hello_tinytorch() -> str:
    """
    Return a greeting message for new TinyTorch users.
    
    Returns:
        A welcoming message string
    """
    return "ðŸ”¥ Welcome to TinyTorch! Ready to build ML systems from scratch! ðŸ”¥"
```

**Step 3: Test your implementation**
```bash
# Run the pytest test suite
python3 -m pytest projects/setup/test_setup.py -v

# Or run the CLI test command
tito test --project setup

# Run comprehensive setup check
python3 projects/setup/check_setup.py
```

## ðŸ§ª Verification & Next Steps

**Run the setup checker**
```bash
python3 projects/setup/check_setup.py
```

This will verify:
- âœ… Environment is correctly configured
- âœ… All dependencies are installed
- âœ… CLI commands work properly
- âœ… Your hello world function is implemented
- âœ… You're ready for the next project

**Expected Output:**
```
ðŸ”¥ TinyTorch Setup Verification ðŸ”¥
==================================

âœ… Python version: 3.x.x (compatible)
âœ… Dependencies: All installed correctly
âœ… CLI commands: Working properly
âœ… hello_tinytorch(): Implemented correctly
âœ… Test suite: All tests passing

ðŸŽ‰ Setup complete! You're ready to build an ML system from scratch.

Next steps:
  cd ../tensor/
  cat README.md

You can now submit this project:
  tito submit --project setup
```

## ðŸ“š What You've Learned

- **Environment setup**: Python, dependencies, development tools
- **CLI workflow**: Using `tito` commands for testing and status checks
- **Project structure**: How code is organized in TinyTorch
- **Implementation pattern**: Where to write code and how to test it
- **Verification process**: Using automated checkers to validate your work

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Project

Once setup passes, move to your first real implementation:

```bash
cd ../tensor/
cat README.md  # Start building the core tensor system
```
