    "## Element-wise Arithmetic Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Element-wise operations are the workhorses of neural network computation. They apply the same operation to corresponding elements in tensors, often with broadcasting to handle different shapes elegantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Element-wise Operations Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "In neural networks, element-wise operations appear everywhere:\n",
    "- **Activation functions**: Apply ReLU, sigmoid to every element\n",
    "- **Batch normalization**: Subtract mean, divide by std per element\n",
    "- **Loss computation**: Compare predictions vs. targets element-wise\n",
    "- **Gradient updates**: Add scaled gradients to parameters element-wise\n",
    "\n",
    "### Element-wise Addition: The Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "Addition is the simplest and most fundamental operation. Understanding it deeply helps with all others.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Element-wise Addition Visual:\n",
    "[1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6] = [1+4, 2+5, 3+6] = [5, 7, 9]\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix Addition:\n",
    "[[1, 2]]   [[5, 6]]   [[1+5, 2+6]]   [[6, 8]]\n",
    "[[3, 4]] + [[7, 8]] = [[3+7, 4+8]] = [[10, 12]]\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadcasting Addition (Matrix + Vector):\n",
    "[[1, 2]]   [10]   [[1, 2]]   [[10, 10]]   [[11, 12]]\n",
    "[[3, 4]] + [20] = [[3, 4]] + [[20, 20]] = [[23, 24]]\n",

    "  (2,2)   (2,1)      (2,2)    broadcast    result\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadcasting Rules:\n",
    "1. Start from rightmost dimension\n",
    "2. Dimensions must be equal OR one must be 1 OR one must be missing\n",
    "3. Missing dimensions are assumed to be 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: Broadcasting makes tensors of different shapes compatible by automatically expanding dimensions. This is crucial for batch processing where you often add a single bias vector to an entire batch of data.\n",
