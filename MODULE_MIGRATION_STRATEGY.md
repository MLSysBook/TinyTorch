# Module Migration & Testing Strategy

## Overview
Systematic migration of TinyTorch modules to nbgrader with comprehensive testing at each step.

## Per-Module Testing Checklist

### 1. **Instructor Solution Verification**
- [ ] Verify complete instructor solution exists (`*_dev_enhanced.py`)
- [ ] Test instructor solution executes without errors
- [ ] Verify all nbgrader markers are present (`### BEGIN/END SOLUTION`)
- [ ] Test nbdev export works (`tito module export <module>`)
- [ ] Verify exported package functionality
- [ ] Run module tests (`tito module test <module>`)

### 2. **Assignment Generation & Validation**
- [ ] Generate assignment (`tito nbgrader generate <module>`)
- [ ] Verify assignment file structure in `assignments/source/<module>/`
- [ ] Inspect generated assignment for proper student scaffolding
- [ ] Verify nbgrader metadata is correct (point values, cell types)
- [ ] Test assignment loads properly in Jupyter

### 3. **NBGrader Workflow Testing**
- [ ] **Release**: `tito nbgrader release <module>`
- [ ] **Collect**: Simulate student submission and `tito nbgrader collect <module>`
- [ ] **Autograde**: `tito nbgrader autograde <module>`
- [ ] **Feedback**: `tito nbgrader feedback <module>`
- [ ] Verify each step creates appropriate directory structure

### 4. **Student Journey Simulation**
- [ ] Copy released assignment to student workspace
- [ ] Attempt to complete assignment as student
- [ ] Verify student scaffolding is helpful but not giving away answers
- [ ] Test submission process
- [ ] Verify auto-grading catches both correct and incorrect solutions

### 5. **Integration Testing**
- [ ] Test nbdev integration (`tito module export <module>`)
- [ ] Verify package functionality after export
- [ ] Test integration with other modules (dependencies)
- [ ] Verify CLI commands work correctly
- [ ] Test module status reporting

### 6. **Documentation & Git**
- [ ] Document any issues found and resolved
- [ ] Update module README if needed
- [ ] Commit changes with descriptive message
- [ ] Tag successful completion

## Testing Framework Setup

### Directory Structure for Testing
```
testing/
├── instructor/          # Instructor workspace
├── student/            # Student workspace simulation
├── submissions/        # Mock student submissions
└── logs/              # Test execution logs
```

### Mock Student Workflow
1. **Setup Student Environment**: Clean workspace with released assignments
2. **Attempt Solutions**: Implement partial/complete/incorrect solutions
3. **Submit**: Place in appropriate submission directory
4. **Grade**: Run auto-grading pipeline
5. **Feedback**: Generate and review feedback

### Integration Points
- **NBDev Export**: After each module, test package export
- **Dependencies**: Verify new modules work with previously migrated ones
- **CLI Integration**: Test all `tito` commands work correctly

## Module Migration Order
1. **00_setup** - Foundation, no dependencies
2. **01_tensor** - Core data structure
3. **02_activations** - Mathematical functions
4. **03_layers** - Depends on activations
5. **04_networks** - Depends on layers
6. **05_cnn** - Advanced layers
7. **06_dataloader** - Data processing

## Success Criteria per Module
- ✅ Instructor solution executes perfectly
- ✅ NBGrader workflow completes without errors
- ✅ Student assignment is educational and challenging
- ✅ Auto-grading works correctly
- ✅ Package integration maintained
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Documentation updated

## Risk Mitigation
- **Backup Strategy**: Keep original files until migration confirmed
- **Rollback Plan**: Each module can be reverted independently
- **Testing Isolation**: Test each module in isolation before integration
- **Progressive Integration**: Add modules incrementally to package

## Execution Timeline
- **Per Module**: ~30-45 minutes comprehensive testing
- **Total Estimated**: 3-4 hours for complete migration
- **Checkpoints**: After every 2 modules, full integration test

## Documentation Requirements
- **Issue Log**: Track and resolve any problems found
- **Solution Notes**: Document any non-obvious implementation details
- **Student Feedback**: Note areas where student scaffolding could improve
- **Integration Notes**: Document inter-module dependencies and interactions
